FIBONACCI CONFLUENCE ZONES WITH THE SQUARE OF NINE

<span id="chapter-3"></span>

CHAPTER 3

A Common Error by Readers of Fibonacci Analysis

No student of mine was allowed to move forward into Gann Analysis without leaming how to create Fibonacci confluence zones. This would frustrate the heck out of some people, but it taught students how to read price data and develop an understanding of how markets create intemal markers within the price swings that define future proportional swings. Many of these lessons are applied later with advanced work using Gann analysis. For example, several methods have a higher probability when strong bars and gaps are used. Gann Wheels projected from more than just the price low or high can define confluence zones to identify which target is the more probable level to end an intermediate or long-term rally when two major time factors create doubt.

This chapter is not intended to summarize my book Fibonacci Analysis; rather, it is to ensure that someone unfamiliar with the concept and method has a start with the basic premise. The concept will appear in ways you did not expect in this book, but introducing it now allows me the opportunity to highlight a common error many beginners make.

A Peking University Professor submitted a paper for publication when I was the editor of the Market Technician Association’s Joumal. The professor conduded that stochastics does not work. Others have stated similar condusions about Fibonacci when they do not know how to apply it correctly in expanding and contracting market action.

The association was angry when our committee of reviewers dedined the professor’s paper. The problem was not his condusion, but what he was testing. He tested the premise that one should sell when the stochastic oscillator crosses 8O and buy when it crosses up through 2O. George Lane knew this did not work. This was not how George Lane used the oscillator. How did the industry develop this idea? George explained that the company he worked for at that time was anxious to release this secret new weapon, as it would bring in dients thinking that the company had an edge. They made the marketing decision to release it prematurely and went ahead and wrote the instructions when George had refused to do so as it was still being tested. Yes, the marketing department wrote those instructions.

George explained that they released the formula with their ideas about how it worked, and the instructions were passed from software vendor to software vendor. The subscribers leamed from the software vendors. That continues today and will likely be propagated for decades to come. George deared this up in his own publication called “First Step to Easy Street,” but the industry never changed their in- correct assumptions. In fact, when the oscillator first crossed down through 8O and passed back up through the 8O level, it was a buy signal as only half the rally was completed, said George. The same held true for the 2O level. Cross above 2O and then fail and break back down through 2O is a sell signal with only half the price dedine in

place from the price associated with the oscillator high that started the momentum swing down to break the 2O level the first time. Anyone attempting to prodaim that a method works or doesn’t work should first make the effort to research how a method is used by those who find it of great value. Then test that method as applied by those who value it to see if it works or not.

Fibonacci retracements do not work by simply selecting a price high and a price low to subdivide the range into the ratios 38.2%, SO%, and 6I.8%. Why not? Markets expand and contract most of the time. The method of slapping a Fibonacci divided range over the exact price high to the extreme price swing low assumes markets develop swings above a midpoint equal in length to the swings below the midpoint in an uptrend. The reverse is assumed for dedines. Yet one will be hard-pressed to find such a market that develops equi- librium or proportional swings throughout the duration of the trend. Accelerating dedines develop longer swings into the bottoms relative to the early swings that begin the move down. Rallies that are losing momentum have swings that begin to contract relative to the swings early in the advance. But markets plant intemal markers on how they will develop future swings in expanding, contracting, and equi- librium market conditions. The markers are gaps and strong or long bars. Using these markers to define ranges will mean that a shallow retracement can be defined before you find yourself left out of the resuming trend. It also means that deeper retracements will be iden- tified before your stops are hit and the market moves in the direction you first thought it would go. It applies to any time horizon, be it data displayed in bars of 3-months or 3-minutes. Using these intemal markers allows us to create high-probability price targets for support or resistance.

II. Fibonacci Confluence Zones with the Square of Nine

<span id="chapter-3-a"></span>

A. THE BASIC PREMISE

To define levels of support, the range selected will always begin from the top of a strong bar. The top of a bar is a price “High”, but it does not mean the high of a swing. In fact, you do not want direc- tional signals such as key reversals to start the range. Why? Nearly everyone in the key reversal is a loser. Why do you want to bank on this data? A high means any top of a strong bar and often it will be an intemal bar within a swing.

Figure 3.I is a 2-week bar chart for Caterpillar (CAT). We are cal- culating support. The start of the first range is the small retracement after the deep key reversal to the left of the word start. These levels of support were first defined four weeks before the last two bars de- veloped in the chart. It was sent to dients with confluence zones ‘I’ and ‘2’ identified before the breakdown. Why did I start at the level marked start? That small retracement was the first swing up after the sharp key reversal or what some would also call a set of railway tracks.

The price high is also a key reversal. Do not use directional signals. Off the price high there follows a period of volatility of back and forth swings. None of that data is helpful relative to the current data that was the small bounce after the second key reversal. The key reversal left of the word start is the critical failure, because it fails under the switch-back range of swings that followed the market top.

The top of the selected bar sets the start and the first range that ends at ‘A.’ Why was ‘A’ selected? ‘A’ is a strong bar within the rally. The second range begins at ‘start’ again and the end of the range selected is the strong bar at ‘B’. Why? ‘B’ is the start of wave iii of (I) up. Third waves are always important even when they are only in the first swing of a larger move. If you do not know the Elliott Wave

Figure 3.I. Fibonacci Confluence Zone.

Principle, think of it this way: if you bought, you would have been brilliant and experienced no challenge to your position. The trend takes off rapidly.

Gann makes the point that the extreme ending of a swing, or, as he calls it, the campaign, ends the prior trend but does not begin the next. Perhaps this is the reason just the smallest first retracement into the new trend gives such better accuracy when a range is defined for Fibonacci calculations.

The third range begins at start again and ends at ‘C.’ Why? This last range ends at a strong bar that is a gap as well. Gaps and strong bars are always important, even if the gap is extremely narrow.

BASIC RULE FOR DEFINING SUPPORT: Ranges start from the top of a strong bar and end on a price bar low. Every range begins from the same bar high as the first and ends on a successive series of new price bar lows. You are working to define support. Therefore, the subdivisions of your range must be below the dose of the recent bar.

BASIC RULE FOR DEFINING RESISTANCE: Ranges start from the bottom of a strong bar and end at the price high of a bar. Every range will begin at the same price bar low as the first se- lected. Every range will end on the top of a bar. Do not just use the endings of swings within your chart. This is why I forced everyone I taught to leam this method; it is extremely accurate and teaches you how to look at all your data and not just the start and end of swing pivot points. You are going to use these same important intemal price bars that are long or at gaps in various ways when we address Gann methods. If you cannot see these bars to begin with, you are toast before you begin.

II. Fibonacci Confluence Zones with the Square of Nine

Confluence is the overlap or near proximity of at least two different Fibonacci ratios. Confluence zone I is a SO% and 38.2% retracement. Confluence zone 2 is also a SO% and 38.2% retracement. Confluence zone 2 is harder to see. It is the dashed line directly on top of the solid. What about the solid black horizontal line just over confluence zone 2? It could be viewed as the cap of confluence zone 2, but if you are a buyer you must keep stops out of this entire range. The stop goes under confluence zone 2 when you are a buyer at this zone in shorter horizon positions. But longer horizon positions need a stop placed two confluence zones away. As an example, if you bought into con- fluence zone I, the stop would be under 2. You need an upside target at least three times the spread between the two zones. If you bought at zone 2 for a longer horizon position, where would you place the stop? This chart would have to have additional Fibonacci ranges defined with an end below ‘C’ not in view. You have to define a third confluence zone.

What if the price low to the bottom left in Figure 3.I was the historic low in the market? You'll like this one. You use confluence zone 2 as a ‘start’ level of an imaginary range, and the ending levels of the range are the price lows of strong bars you do have in view in the chart. How can this work? Remember, adding, subtracting, dividing, or multiplying any Fibonacci number will produce a new Fibonacci number. So, using confluence zone 2 to create confluence under this level in an extreme data-limitation situation is extremely effective. That is an advanced method, so leam the basic method first, please.

Only subdivide ranges by 38.2, SO, and 6I.8 percent ratios. Why? Using multiple price ranges will pick up any other Fibonacci ratio up of importance through the creation of confluence zones. The most important ratios to overlap are the 38.2 and 6I.6 percent ratios. Do

3. A Common Error by Readers of Fibonacci Analysis 4I

not use 2S or 7S percent as the confluence that forms on your screen will be misleading. Then be sure to save the three ratios as your default. By creating multiple subdivisions from different ranges, you will pick up other Fibonacci ratios regardless, because the addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of Fibonacci ratios will create other Fibonacci ratios. We do not need a label for sub-ratios, just the confluence zone. So, don’t ever dutter your screen with the vendors’ default. That will just add noise to your screen, making it hard to read.

What if level ‘A, the end of a selected range, overlaps a Fibonacci ratio in a larger range? It is not a confluence zone. Only Fibonacci ratios form confluence and the ratios must be different. An ending horizontal line of one range over a Fibonacci ratio does not make confluence. One last one to consider: if you have two ratios falling near one another of the same ratio, the range you selected is too dose and similar to the last range you selected.

The stock CAT, then, fell out of bed falling sharply. It stopped on confluence zone I and defined a decent bounce up. You use your other methods to determine what happens at the confluence zone and whether after the bounce it can hold that trend or fail. Will this stock double bottom at the confluence zone I or break and fall to ‘2’? The Fibonacci confluence zones cannot answer that. But now we have a bigger question: Which confluence zone is more important? Ah, that’s why we will bring Gann analysis into the picture now. You get to the point of being extremely good at these Fibonacci confluence zones when the market respects and confirms you have the method under your belt. Then you start thinking ahead to which zone is the Great Wall of China serving as support for the market longer term. I'll touch on this in the next chapter for you.

Where do people consistently go wrong? Beginners want to start

at the price high. In their view, it does not matter if the price high was five or six years ago. They use it anyway because they only un- derstand and want a set pattem of steps to follow and don’t think about whether what they are doing makes sense or not. Then they want to start at the key reversal just left of the word ‘start’. Beginners only see the starts and ends of swings and never look at intemals in between the swing extremes. It is not entirely their fault. We authors write very little about how to read price data and use intemal price action within a move. I think that is why some find my Fibonacci book difficult at first. They must leam the method and how to read price action at the same time.

Often when selecting the end of the range beginners can only see the end of swings. They never see price “B.’ They jump right past it to the bottom of the swing, or worse to the bottom of the page. This is a bigger error as the spread between confluence zones controls your drawdown and risk exposure. If you leave big gaps or voids between zones, you have no risk management in place. The confluence zones may be correct, but you miss defining so many that you lose one of the prime reasons for going through these steps: minimizing your risk! If your stock chart has a spread of $6O between confluence zones with a price high of $23O, that is a spread that is way too wide to manage the risk. You did not use the intemal strong bars and gaps.

The spread between confluence zones will give the dean appearance you see in Figure 3.I. Your screen should not be filled with unneeded lines and ratios. Another oversight by beginners is not to realize or see the important small gap at “C.’ Gaps should never be overlooked. Eli Tullis taught me that eventually all markets will fill a gap. Might take a long time, but be assured that someday Caterpillar will trade $3S to fill this small gap.

42 II. Fibonacci Confluence Zones with the Square of Nine

What is the most common error beginners make? Using data that has been retraced to define the end ofa range. All the data in the middle of the chart that is corrective into the beginning of 2OI6 cannot be used. Think of it this way, the rally into the high would have stopped anyone out that had a stop loss for a short position established within the rectangle that has an ‘X’ through it. For students who consis- tently make the same error by selecting the end of their range to a price low within the highlighted rectangle area, I change their chart, so it looks like Figure 3.2. But I do not use an ‘X’; I make the entire rectangle a solid black box. That way they cannot see anything in that area of the chart. That data is not what the market is using to build new swings into the future. This finally tums the concept around for those making this error. So, the range selected after ‘B’ was the price bottom of the bar at ‘C.’

What about other price lows at bars elsewhere within the swing? At first you will select many before you leam just to go to the strong bars, and the start of a third wave, the start of wave iii of 3, and gaps. Gaps need not be large. A minute break in continuity within the price action should catch your eye. My only goal is to define confluence price zones. My charts are always dean as far as how the confluence zones appear within the chart. If the range just gives noise, keep moving down when selecting the price low of a subsequent lower bar or use a different time interval. People at first try to obtain daily confluence levels of support and resistance from within weekly prices. You need to see the intemals of the daily data if that is the spread between zones you need. They are different exercises, though at some point the charts will both identify a zone that is similar. However,

when I started I had a spreadsheet into which I entered the price low of every single bar. When the price low was at a gap, I made a note in the spreadsheet by putting ‘g’ after the price. When the price low was at a strong bar, I puta ‘t’ beside the price to record a strong thrust action as Joe DiNapoli first taught me.

When I found confluence and studied how the market reacted, it was dear that the market used ranges that induded gaps and strong bars more often and with stronger reactions than any other bar. I no longer needed the spreadsheet and became much faster. I was an off-floor S&PSOO futures trader and had to be fast, as the floor was after my hide. Now algorithms are after us. You can survive what we call a dirty market using these methods. S8&PSOO is a dirty market. It will try several times to chase you out before it finally moves in the direction every indicator favors. There is much more discussion of this in my book Fibonacci Analysis. Leam this please. It works and is incredibly effective based on the many emails I have been sent.

The price reaction to the confluence zone of support in Figure 3.I happens all the time. The market will show you time and again that you have done this method correctly and have gotten it. Start with §- Or IO-minute intraday data so that you can see the results of your calculations work out sooner. Then practice every day. In no time, you will feel lost without this grid on your screen. Indicators give us permission to act. Gann tells us when. I now have over 2OO Hedge Fund managers I taught when this was all new to them. Many feel this methodology is one reason they survived their early years to establish an equity curve they could use to attract investors.

CHAPTER 4

The Elliott Wave Principle—Common Misunderstandings

<span id="chapter-4-a"></span>

A. IMPULSE WAVES

This chapter is offered to address several misunderstandings within our professional community using the Elliott Wave Principle. Many people post wave counts that show they are counting swings as an impulse wave when the swing intemals dearly do not have a five-wave substructure. From large major firms on Wall Street to the inde- pendent with incorrect “Elliot” in their web address, the errors are widespread and epidemic.

There are far too many examples online showing professionals using an Elliott Wave count that labels a price swing and completely ignores this fact, or worse, hopes the intemals of their impulse wave define a legal five-wave substructure somehow within it. There is a way to resolve this extremely common problem, and we will look at the method in a moment.

There is no Elliott interpretation for an impulsive rally that ac- commodates an endless string of “a-b-c, a-b-c, a-b-c, a-b-c’s”... forever. An analyst will need to re-evaluate their wave structure, especially when the strong rally is an extending third wave with in- temal five-wave components throughout it. What about a termination wedge? A termination wedge will not have continually expanding and well-defined five-wave impulse waves. The termination wedge has a geometric set of proportions we will cover in a moment. Even contracting termination wedges have their limits.

Harmonic Waves are neither harmonic nor based on the principles of R.N. Elliott. If someone wants to define their own wave counting method, great! Just do not call it Elliott, please, and confuse all the people who want to leam the method of R.N. Elliott.

People hate the Elliott Wave Principle because they think it is too subjective, and it is when so many people are breaking the basic rules and guidelines. So, everyone... back to school. If you are brand new to Elliott, you are innocent and excused. This is not intended to be a first-introduction review. But you are welcome to join us, knowing you are not one of the guilty.

Figure 4.I is a simple rally displaying five waves up. Waves I, 3, and S all have intemals that can be subdivided into their own set of five waves. This market just happens to conveniently end the impulse and corrective waves on swings. This rarely happens. When you are honest about evaluating the intemal structure of your impulse waves, you end up with extensions, orthodox tops that are broken by ‘B’ waves, a host of reasons why most trends need patience to count their structure.

The easiest and most accurate place to start an Elliott Wave count is to find the strongest swing in the middle of the move. If it is very strong, find the middle segment of that strong move that contains its own private set of five waves within the larger strong move. That is wave iii of 3. I draw a box around each five-wave subdivision. It helps

{ 47}

48 III. The Elliott Wave Principle

evaluate balance and proportions as well. Then there’s a small pullback and up to wave ‘v’ of 3. Wave ‘v’ must dearly define a five-wave substructure. Now work below the start of wave iit. Fill in waves ‘i’ of 3 and ii of 3. Always start in the middle. Why? It is about proportions as much as it is about substructure. Start in the middle so you end on the correct swing.

Draw a box around what you think is wave 3. In Figure 4.I this box runs from the bottom of wave 2 to the top of wave 3. Always check that the wave you just endosed within these labels has five waves within the box. Not five? Not a complete wave. It is that simple. Do not cheat or the market will whack you hard to prove the error.

Then count your fourth wave. Wave 4 down in Figure 4.I falls to the vicinity of the previous fourth wave within your third wave box. Perfect, this is the best way to find your bearings. Fourth wave cor- rections love to gather with other fourth waves of lesser degree near the same price level lows. Notice the dedine from wave S? It joined two other previous fourth-wave pullbacks. In real time it then took off like a scared rabbit and made new highs.

Next, count your fifth wave up. Wait, we ignored wave I! Yes. We did. We didn’t start our count at wave I either. Who cares if you have a perfect wave I? Get wave S right as that is the current market po- sition and has immediate implications on what we may be facing next in the coming bars or candles. There are many analysts prodaiming the end of the world for stocks as we begin the 2OI8 correction. Not possible if you study the global market proportions by starting the wave counts from middle segments. This volatility in 2OI8 is going to prove itself to be a correction in a fourth-wave position in global equities.

While wave I was ignored initially, now go back to wave I after

you define wave S. Is it a dean five-wave structure? No? Then you have an extending impulse wave and the early overlapping swings will need to be offset or duplicated at the top. What do we mean by offset? Markets tend to repeat the price character into their final top the way they started the move. Lots of back-n-fill action in the be- ginning with overlapping first and second waves is often what to expect into the final highs.

Then ask yourself about proportions. Is wave 3 the shortest as compared to waves I and S? Yes? Then you have another first wave up in the middle of your rally. You will need to remove the implied ending label for wave 3. If wave 3 is not the shortest, you are Okay. Wave 3 does not have to be the longest, just not the shortest.

Can I change my screen to percentage log and get away with a third wave that looks funky in arithmetic scale and breaks the rules? In my opinion, no. That is where Elliott Wave Intemational and I will agree to disagree. For those who do not know my history, I was once the institution division analyst of the S&PSOO for Bob Prechter in I996. We parted ways when my wave count was wave (I) up, (2) down, I up, 2 down, ‘i’ up... you have the picture. The firm was looking for a Grand Super Cyde top. I could not have been more polar in my market opinion by counting ones and twos. Why was I so dif- ferent? I build wave counts from correlated markets and stock sector intemals. If you only focus on and count the wave structure within a single market, you will run into problems. But do not think I mean to say I get it right all the time. I do not. Quantitative Easing taught me new lessons about Gold, the Dollar, and stock indexes. At that time, I did not know the QE formula that banks were only allowed to buy specific instruments like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the DJIA when the Federal Reserve paid them for their toxic assets. An out-

4. The Elliott Wave Principle—Common Misunderstandings

of-print Treasury document explained what I was missing. It spelled out the entire formula they used with the requirements of each step. I will post it online for those interested.* There is always something new to leam in our business. I was out of sync early in the QE cyde.

The introduction of new technology impacts the duration of a trend. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was once heard to say that one of his great errors was under-estimating the impact the Intemet would have on business. The Elliott Wave practitioner will see these extensions within the underlying stock leaders. The ex- haustion wamings come in the mid- or small-cap stocks. Use mutual fund NAV charts restricted to these stock capitalization profiles as an index. Track the largest six funds based on assets under management within their group. This approach is more accurate than the more widely followed Russell or S&PSOO mid-cap indexes.

Figure 4.2 asks the question, What is the minimum number of bars or candles you need in order to have a complete five-wave structure? The answer is three. Consider Figure 4.2. If the detailed swing in- temals are daily, and you agree with me that this is a valid five-wave structure, then if I go up in time to a 2-week chart the data would compress to the appearance in the top-right. If my 2-week chart was compressed further into a monthly chart, it would look like the bottom right.

Is wave 3 the shortest? No.

Are there distinct second and fourth wave pullbacks? Yes. A bar that just retraces part of the prior bar counts as a corrective wave. But then you have to ask, Does wave 4 break the end of wave I? No. This is a valid five-wave impulse wave in only three bars. Knowing

* https://www.linkedin.com/in/connie-brown-mfta-OI474bI 39/4.

this is incredibly useful for developing all wave counts. It ensures the subdivisions of our interpretations remain true to the basic tenets of the Wave Principle.

Figure 4.3 in the market data on the left is asking, What are the three swings with three question marks? The first swing down from (4) up to the first question mark is a dean easy five-wave move. That means a bounce up and a drop to the second ‘?’ plus a bounce up and a drop to the lowest ‘?’ could be wave B down as it is three waves. The bounce up from the first ‘?’ would be ‘A’ up, then ‘B’ down defining three waves for wave B. This is then followed by wave C up. How do you tell? You cannot—at least not from wave structure alone. You must have a Time Factor and use oscillators and fan angles. For years when I did not have these tools I would also use a longer time horizon and a correlated market to help me. I still do this. The frame on the right is the best wave interpretation using just the price data in Figure 4.3- A helpful method is to use a detrended simple 7-period moving average. You must use this oscillator on two different time horizons side-by-side. The best time ratio is four-to-one, for example, 24O- minutes to 6O-minutes. You will assuredly see me use this detrended oscillator in this book. One example of this oscillator can be found in Appendix M when it called the top of the DJIA a couple of months ago in January 2OI8. The Wave Principle alone does not make these market calls for you. Add Gann Time Factors with a simple detrend oscillator and you will have far greater success.

Another one of my keep-out-of-trouble secrets is coming up.

Termination wedges end trends, but many traders have been de- stroyed trying to find their top. They are elongated triangles that define higher tops and higher bottoms. (Lower tops, lower bottoms coming into a bottom.) The problem is that, we all know we are in

Figure 4.2. Impulse waves Expressed in Three Bars. Figure 4.3. Extending Impulse Wave.

SO III. THE ELLIOTT WAVE PRINCIPLE

4. The Elliott Wave Principle—Common Misunderstandings SI

such a pattem, but few can call the market top. The secret is not the structure, but the slope. Draw a line from the start of your first wave to its end. Then connect the start of wave 3 upwards to where you think it ends. Do the same for the fifth. The slope for each wave should fall forward in an uptrend or flatten near a bottom. Study the image in Figure 4.4. If waves I and 3 have similar slopes, you can likely count on the third wave to be the end of the swing, not the entire pattem. Most likely, still ahead is the fourth wave down and fifth wave up to end the move. Look for the Time Factors that fit this scenario. The reaction will be swift and moves back to the origin of the wedge pattem. The costly part of this pattem is being out of sync in waves 4 and S. You have lost money and when it hits, you find your head is not in the game. That means you do not trade the resolution well either.

<span id="chapter-4-b"></span>

B. CORRECTIVE WAVES

A Zigzag correction in Figure 4.6 defines the first swing with a five-wave move against the larger trend. Don’t get hung up on the S-3-S mantra. Feel it—a sharp reversal, a choppy middle, a sharp re- versal. Best tools are Fibonacci confluence zones because you can see the pattem in the way the confluence zone forms within the chart. There is a void between zones, a congested area of single Fibonacci ratios, followed by a void to another confluence zone. The zigzag is identified before it begins. Look for the Time Factor on the second confluence zone. That’s the target date to end the correction.

We have a big problem in our industry with triangles based on professional public postings. Triangles cannot have five swings that stand alone. Each completed wave within a triangle must have three waves. If the first wave in a counter-trend move displays five waves,

it is going to be a developing Zigzag. Five wave swings cannot stand by themselves within the triangle... no matter how nicely it defines the outside contracting or expanding trendlines of the pattem. Ifitisa five-wave swing it must be wave A. Then we define a wave B triangle, followed by wave C into a deeper correction. Many professionals have forgotten this rule: each swing must be 3’s within a triangle. Guideline of altemation applies in triangles as well. Triangles that expand or contract tend to find new pattems for each swing. The most lethal is wave C ina triangle. They never want to end and love to run everyone over on both sides of the market. The cool thing about triangles is that the Gann analyst knows where they are lurking. How? A mass gathering of time factors. Like Fibonacci confluence zones, markets move swiftly and deanly between Fibonacci confluences that have wide voids between them offering little resistance. Time is similar in concept. Markets run fastest when no time factor is present.

Question for you: Where else may wave ‘C’s exhibit a 3-wave pattem?

Nowhere else; this is a trick question! All other ‘C’s will be five-wave structures that end corrections. A triangle is the only exception and it is not the end of the correction.

Flats and Expanded Flats are displayed in Figure 4.9. Wave C will exceed the bottom of ‘A’ in the corrective pattem. People get hung-up on the ‘B’ wave. Here’s the thing, if you see a choppy move and cannot see a five-wave structure... it is three waves. Don’t get too anal on all the intemals within wave B. You will hit a Time Factor and launch. We like these as they are money-makers. Then we get to ride it back in the direction of the larger trend. The best comple- mentary tool to use here is the Composite Index on two different time intervals. When they have conflicts, as when the daily chart is way

oversold, and the weekly chart is overbought, these Expanded Flats show up. This allows the daily chart to realign with the weekly chart again and then both hammer the market together.

That should dear-up some misunderstandings. The labels for degrees are always a problem. That is because we grab the label we can most easily type. (I am guilty of this, too.) Numbers in cirdes are special characters within Windows 8.I and higher. Go to ‘Insert’ in Microsoft Word, then ‘Symbols’ on the far right. Select ‘symbol’ in the submenu. Cirded numbers are in “Cambria Math.”

I know there is a big question remaining: How do you handle complex corrective waves? Use Gann analysis with Elliott. Gann tells us when, Elliott then paints a pattem to get us into the pivot timing. Complex waves form when Time Factors duster over a wide band of time and the horizontal Fibonacci confluence zones compress into complex congested bands. The complex correction will not end until the last Gann Time cyde within the Time Factor duster has been realized. That last sentence is extremely important, and I have the scars to prove it.

Title: Computer program code for the Composite Index / Constance M. Brown

Date of Creation: I996

Manny Stoller was my boss and first mentor. If there is anyone whom I must acknowledge for the Composite Index, it is Manny. He was on the IoSth floor of the North Tower and took me in as a total novice when no one would help. With grace he heard endless questions asked of him, and then he asked follow-up questions that forced me to think, explore, and grow in my abilities. The Com- posite Index was the answer to such a question. Telerate’s TeleTrac system was a DOS-based program limited to eight fixed post- age-stamp-sized frames. When I wanted to add a ninth window, it

was Manny who said that I must leam how to combine and imbed formulas to solve the problem. The result was imbedding Mo- mentum within RSI and discovering a solution that far exceeded the original problem. I personally installed the resulting formula into the computer of an RSI specialist, who then tried to reintroduce it as his own. The lesson for all is to keep careful records of your own work, to copyright new findings, and then to record in public how you intend them to be used and the methodology of how they were developed.

The problem we faced several decades ago is still present today: The Relative Strength Index (RSI), as developed by Welles Wilder, does not develop oscillator divergences against long-horizon price data when major trend reversals are near. The failure to display di- vergence signals in this widely relied-upon indicator is costly for all who use it. I want to give you the Composite Index formula because this oscillator is below many charts in this book. It is my principle oscillator. Bloomberg will program it for you on request. Optuma already has the Composite Index induded in their menu. The Trade- Station format is below. Several other vendors have the formula as well. Just ask them if you do not see it.

The Composite Index formula is as follows:

(Omega TradeStation format):

{S9 }

6O II. The Elliott Wave Principle

PlotI(RSIMO9+RSI3,”PlotI”); Plot2(average((plotr),I3),”Plot2”);

Plot3(average((plotz),33),” Plot3”);

The function RSIMOg is written; RSIMO9 = MOMENTUM(RSI (CLOSE,I4),9)

The second function is written RSI3=A VERAGE(RSI(CLOSE,3),3)

The Composite Index has two components. The first, called RSIMOo, is a 9-period Momentum indicator on a I4-period RSI. Momentum is simply a comparison between the current period to x periods earlier. The second function is a 3-period simple moving average to smooth a very fast 3-period RSI indicator. The two are added together to define ‘Plot I.’ Then put a simple I3-period and 33- period moving average of the ‘RSIMO9+RSI3’ Composite formula. In many charts you will see this oscillator plotted beneath price data in several markets and time horizons.

My Master’s Thesis detailed a computer-defined divergence study of the Composite Index in six different markets: German Dax, French CAC 4O, China Shanghai Composite, DJIA, IO-Year U.S. Gov- emment Treasury Notes, and the IO-Year Japanese Govemment Bond.*

There were I7 ‘Buy’ signals and 2S ‘Sell’ signals. Four additional ‘Sell’ signals were ‘open’ as they were at the end of the price action and the resolution was still ahead. A month later all four of the addi- tional ‘Sell’ signals had given accurate wamings of market dedines

greater than a 3S percent retracement relative to the prior swing. The full criteria are defined in the paper. Of the computer-generated signal totals in 2-month and monthly data, only five signals failed. Figure S.I is a chart from this study in the paper. It shows the divergences identified by the computer in the German Dax 2-month chart from I984 to 2OI6.

B. USING THE COMPOSITE INDEX TO DEFINE ELLIOTT WAVE STRUCTURE

While the Composite Index is a better performing oscillator for di- vergence analysis than RSI, it does not have the range rule character I described in Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional, 2nd Edition. Therefore, the Composite Index is on the bottom of all my screens, but occasionally I scan the I4-period RSI in different chart setups to view how the range of that indicator is positioned in weekly or monthly data. Briefly what I show is that RSI in bull markets will fall back to 4O and rally up through 68. But bear markets fail near RSI I4-period levels near 68 and fall through the 4O level. This is valuable trend analysis, so I have not entirely abandoned RSI. However, it is the only reason I look at RSJ at all.

Over the years of using my Composite Index I have leamed it has other valuable applications other than divergence analysis. It can help determine the probability of a given signal, and it can be used to develop Elliott Wave interpretations.

Figure S.2 is India’s BSE 3O in a monthly chart. The chart shows the Fibonacci confluence zones of support. The market has tested a con- fluence zone and reacted to it. Under the price data is the Composite Index. A horizontal band has been drawn where the oscillator used

this momentum displacement for support or resistance. The number of times this market respects this momentum displacement area is the probability of it reacting at this level in an expected way in the future. At pivot points 2, 3, and 4, the market rallied from these areas. What is not shown is that each oscillator pivot occurred when the market had pulled back to a Fibonacci confluence zone of support. What about I? While it does serve as resistance, one signal alone cannot give you a sense of the probability of the signal. If you extend your view of historic data, you would find that there is no historical os- cillator swing at this level that became resistance. Therefore, it does not give you permission to act.

The best signals are not divergence signals at the extremes; the best are the simple crests and troughs that form a historical record in the middle of the range. Draw a horizontal line across your chart and examine the past reactions at the same displacement. If you see it always results in a sucker punch, you know not to take action. If it always accompanies a price swing reversal, take notice. This is in- credibly valuable when you want to know how to get into a market that is relentlessly extending.

Another use is observing that pivots 3 and 4 are the same dis- placement levels where a second and fourth Elliott Wave occurs. This is the pattem you will see to darify the degree of the wave structure that is developing. Another oscillator pattem to take notice of is that the maximum oscillator peak or trough will be the end of wave iii of 3. The first divergence peak will end wave v of 3. The second divergence

II. The Elliott Wave Principle

will end wave v of S. I lean on this often as it is very repeatable. The same is true for the reverse.

Clearly you need to be an Elliott Wave practitioner and this book is not the place for me to cover that topic. You will find impulse waves described in my book, Mastering Elliott Wave Principle: Elementary Concepts, Wave Pattems, and Practice Exercises. A second book, which was written but never given to Wiley, promised to cover corrective waves. The first book was stolen in illegal translations before it was delivered from the printers, and the publisher would not take legal action to protect the copyright. Therefore, I withheld the second book. The title of this second book on corrective waves continues to be displayed on Amazon. I have asked that it be removed but have no control. As it was a contracted book I cannot release the manuscript intended for Wiley. I would have to do something entirely different and this work regarding Gann Analysis had a higher priority for me. I’ll figure out how to do the corrective waves material for you someday. It’s on my to-do list. At least you know the inside story re- garding the mystery book that no one can find.

Ona last thought for Figure S.2, someone is going to wonder how I would have handled the Composite Index as it fell through the hor- izontal line marking 4 in the most recent pullback. That is why the Fibonacci confluence zones were created within this chart. When the oscillator was on the horizontal level at 4 on the Composite Index, the market was not on a Fibonacci confluence zone of support. Both need to be in place as a confirmation.

PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS—LOGIC ALGORITHMS AND CRITICAL REASONING

<span id="chapter-6"></span>

CHAPTER 6

Structured Critical Reasoning

In I99O the Bureau of Engraving and Printing added the first se- curity thread and microprinting to the $IOO bill. It was not a smooth transition.

There are various types of inks used to produce banknotes. There are optically variable inks allowing the note to change color at dif- ferent angles of view. Some inks must react to infrared light. It is the flow of ink, called rheology, that is the critical component in the printing steps.

The Bureau of Engraving and Printing’s paper has been purchased from the same company (Crane and Company) since I879. It is a blend of 7S percent cotton and 2S percent linen. The paper itself has embedded fluorescent security threads, watermarks, and blue and red fibers.

The process to make U.S. banknotes is very complicated and has three main steps: offset lithography, intaglio, and letterpress. The first pass is through a press where the face and back are printed si- multaneously. The offset press can print eight colors on each side and holds 2O,OOO sheets of paper. The press can strike IO,OOO sheets per hour with 32 notes per sheet.

Next the printed sheets must dry for 72 hours and move on to the intaglio process. This step gives the raised tactile feel to the notes; only one side at a time may be printed. This direct inking system of plates can produce 8,OOO sheets per hour.

The next step will print the finely engraved line work. The last step applies serial numbers and seals. It is this final step where the printed sheets become legal currency.

The apprenticeship program to become an engraver with the Bureau is ten years.

Imagine you are the production manager in I99O and you have been with the Bureau for twenty years. Lucky you! But, they don’t give free samples, so maybe not so lucky. Worse, I99O is when a major technical change is being made to your finely-tuned, well-controlled production line.

CASE SITUATION TI:

This is a real situation that occurred in I99O. When the Bureau makes a test run of the new equipment, they discover that the inks on the new bills smear when touched. That’s a big problem for a banknote. It is a problem that has landed on your watch.

You struggle with various ideas to solve the problem of the inks, and after I6 months, universities are contracted to help. Then all these university contracts are suddenly cancelled. The question is, what had been discovered?

SITUATION ANALYSIS:

Could you have thought outside the perceived problem of ink smearing? As long as you stayed focused on the inks, you never

{ 67 }

68 IV. Problem-Solving Skills

would have found a solution. What they found was that there was insufficient pressure in the printing process for the inks to penetrate the paper.

CASE SITUATION 2:

This is a real case study. In Southeastem Australia the govemment constructed a dam across the Murray River. While I could be wrong on its name, I believe it was the Hume Dam built between I9I9 and I936. The area is arid, and officials believed they could bring agri- culture to the area if only irrigation was available.

Thousands of people and big bucks were needed to build it. They did all their plans and committee studies and pressed ever onwards. The day came with much excitement when the new arid lands would receive water. The seeds were planted, and all was in place. What happened? Not only did the seeds die when they germinated, but so too did all the natural scrub plants as well. What did they forget in their planning steps?

SITUATION ANALYSIS:

Something is wrong with the water? No. Something is wrong with the type of seed planted? No.

They never took a soil sample before building the dam. Their entire focus and understanding of the problem was the need of water. However, introducing water to arid soil leached centuries of salts out of the soil, killing everything. I suspect that a hundred years later this original outcome has long been forgotten.

There are two schools of thought conceming problem solving. I introduced this segment into my 3-day courses and found it was ex- tremely popular. Let’s take a look at the first.

Structured Critical Reasoning, or SCR for short, is an algorithm used for proposition and problem solving. In contrast, the second school of thought to be covered in the next chapter is called Socratic Questioning. This is where we leam a way to ask the right questions to find the real problems hidden within perceived problems.

The SCR algorithm has five steps. You start from a condusion and work backwards.

I. CONCLUSION: The words used are “therefore, consequently, leads us to..., proves that..., the point is....”

2. EVIDENCE: Find the reasons and evidence leading to the con- dusion. Find the facts, data, repeatable observations, research findings, true because of «x.

3. ASSUMPTIONS: Wow, is this a Pandora’s Box in our industry! An assumption is a belief used to support the evidence in step 2. Ask yourself if the assumption is relevant to the con- dusion. Wish I had a dollar for every time a seminar participant stated, “Well, there is a divergence signal here, so we will go up.” Problem being that their divergence signal was three years ago and the market is already up. That observation does nothing for where we are now and what could happen next. (Ask yourself: Does the assumption have contradictions? Can it support the evidence and in tum the condusion?

CASE SITUATION:

You are managing a pig farm in Califomia and have twelve years of experience dealing with govemment regulators. One day the farm owner comes to you with a burr under his saddle and states he has been asked to reduce the farm’s toxic waste because the young gov- emment agent he just met is threatening to shut the operation down.

What do you do next?

Begin with a question about the question itself. You are being asked to reduce toxic waste. Ask the owner, “Where did the problem originate?” You leam that someone is pointing a finger at your farm as being the reason that a few dead fish are showing up in the river. A letter was published in the local newspaper’s editorial column. Now bad publicity is growing in the area based on this letter.

Now you can ask a question for darification. Newspapers are no- torious for being biased, and this letter to the editor likely contains few facts. Ask the farm owner how he arrived at the condusion that his farm is the cause. You leam that he knows the water levels are low due to the drought and that the farm is causing higher concen- trations of toxins. The farm operations have not changed; he believes the cause has to be due to the lower water levels.

Following the logic tree given at the start of this chapter, you now need to ask a question that probes the owner’s assumptions. You ask if the govemment agent tested the river water. You leam that the concentration of toxins in the river was not measured.

Now you can ask questions to leam more about the owner’s per- spectives. You ask him, “What would you do?” Together you decide to contact the local agriculture college to see if there is an altemative explanation for why the dead fish were found. You leam that the lower levels in the river mean higher temperatures that make the fish more vulnerable to disease from high fungi toxins.

Now this is really important: how do you follow-up with this new piece of information? You are not done. The local college’s opinion cannot counter the EPA, a department tasked with deaning the en- vironment and with a staff of the opinion that all industry and com- mercial farming is bad. You call in a counter-player by asking the Department of Natural Resources, “Have the fish upstream of the farm or in other rivers experienced die-offs >”

You leam that the govemment official has reports of dead fish along the river and that dead fish have been found in surrounding lakes.

You just won your case regarding the public sentiment based on false assumptions by the letter writer to the editor. Your farm does not have to do a thing but write a rebuttal letter with these new facts.

I find breaks in logic to be a big problem when teaching about technical analysis. The younger the student, the worse the problem becomes. The technical method is assumed to provide the proof and the condusion. It does not!

Our methods are only the tools to help answer the market questions we seek to answer. How often did the signal work in this market and time horizon? What else could occur to add probability to this setup

signal? Do technical counter-signals agree that this could happen? What is a similar market overseas telling us? Do other stocks in the same sector concur?

Always challenge yourself to see what else you could check to form a condusion. Staring at a divergence signal and waiting for it to re- appear is not what we do. We are not signal hunters, we are signal utilizers.

How do you know the market questions to ask?

Ask what evidence is present to indicate the next move. Everything we do must contribute to the movement in the next series of bars. That means that stating that a pivot happened 3 years ago has no value. But seeing that the oscillator is at the same level from 3 years ago and that it reacted with the same outcome four other times in the history of the chart is useable information. Ask yourself, How does knowing this help me determine what follows next?

Have there been similar reactions in other markets with similar volatility? Know when to use different analytic techniques. Ina total waterfall meltdown, do your methods provide guidance? If not, which tools and setups work best? (Short detrend averages.)

What extemal evidence do I have that increases my probability of being right? (See the discussion regarding chart 2.6 in Chapter 2.)

Why is there a conflict in these correlated markets?

Does the matrix of discount rates between Germany, Japan, and the United States allow the Federal Reserve to raise rates further? What are the yield curves of these three markets telling me in my charts? (You cannot analyze American rates in isolation.)

Why are my two gold stocks NEM and GFI developing different pattems? (Different currency basis—one is U.S. dollars and the other is South African Rand.)

IV. Problem-Solving Skills

What are the charts saying about a carry trade unwinding and setting up a big move in the Yen against the U.S. dollar? * Why is the money coming out that triggered the local panic in Japan? This cannot be local. What chart gives the waming? Does the Nasdaq lead Japan’s Nikkei or the other way around?

What happened in the past when Commercial traders where ex- tended on this side of the market?

What potential triggers are present that would account for a series of sharp moves in multiple markets? (For example, charts wam a major reversal in the U.S. dollar and Oil is coming.)

Gann analysis wams a deep dedine is coming in China. Is the move the trigger for other market dedines, or is China part of the reaction to a change? (Major extended rally in Oil; the demise of the EURUSD. Either becomes the cause, rather than the stock index being the cause.) If China falters, how does that impact my other global indexes?

Why is there a connection between the USDJPY, the Toronto TSX, and Oil? Why is the CADJPY an important chart for Crude

* One helpful resource to explain a carry-trade can be found at (https:// www. investopedia.com/terms/c/carry-trade.asp-o). In the Elliott chapter I first men- tioned this tool. It is also useful in strong market meltdown panics—use a simple detrended oscillator, Gann Time intraday, and Elliott Wave. Support/Resistance is Fibonacci confluence zones. If you have to, use a I-minute chart in a crash. It works. The detrended oscillator I use is the spread between a seven and one-period simple moving average. Then detrend the result and plot under the price data. Set up two different time intervals in a 4:I ratio such as 88-minutes on the left and 22- minute bar chart on the right with the detrended oscillators under the price action. Don’t look for conventional divergence; wait until both are at the top or bottom of the screen. In extreme dedines I have used 3-minute and 2I-minute displays just to get the entry timing correct.

Oil traders? (Higher Crude Oil prices are bad for Japan and good for the Canadian dollar.)

I do not trade grains, but why is there a relationship between Wheat and Oil?

How have commodity grain markets been impacted during major market crashes?

Do the historic spikes in Oats and Gold have any value to a S&P SOO trader? Yes. In I999 the markets began to trade like commodity markets. Only the traders with commodity experience did well.

How have technology changes impacted the business cyde and the potential duration of the current market trend in the DJIA? (The birth of the Intemet changed the business cyde and killed the etemal market bears that could not adjust. It hurt economists as well. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said that not making adjustments due to the birth of the Intemet was his greatest error.)

Are there any significant new changes in how businesses com- municate, transport goods, or respond to new consumer buying pattems? (For example, what do charts say about the health and future of Amazon?) How does this change an Elliott Wave count?

How does Quantitative Easing impact the dollar, gold, DJIA, and rate relationships? Do I see these implied relationships in my charts? I was slow in picking up how QE activity impacted the DJIA. Fed buys banks’ toxic waste and bonds. Banks jack up the bond prices; asa result the long end of the curve goes down. (Purpose: Since the short end was locked at zero.) The banks in tum are only allowed to use the funds to buy DJIA stocks and Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac. DJIA goes up, people feel left behind and, voila, off we go again. gork’s are up, the people are happy and consumer sentiment begins to rise. But you saw the QE chart in Chapter I. This is not going to end well.

How many global stock indexes are heavily weighted to bank stocks? What indexes have little exposure to Financials? (Dax, Nikkei, Nasdaq) Should I analyze these three Indexes together? How do I best analyze the Equity Indexes that do have heavy weightings to Bank stocks? (Saudi TASI composition surprised even the Arab dients when I wrote a report about how heavily weighted to Banks their index is and not to favored Sharia Stocks. This wams stock volume is not related to index weighting.)

What stocks currently contribute 2S percent of the weighting within an index? (Nota capitalization question or most active listing description.)

Why are the Toronto Stock Exchange and Saudi TASI markets correlated? (Oil; both are commodity-based economies.)

Why did the Australian All Ordinaries and India’s Nifty both have bottoms in 2OO3 before China’s Shanghai Composite? An economic war between China and the USA began much earlier than econ- omists realized. China was dearly investing in Australia’s and India’s economies, and far less so in the USA, based on the timing and trend percentage gains in chart pattems. Australia and India were the primary benefactors of China’s new markets. Overlay these markets in a 2-month chart for a dear visual.

What can the Hang Seng Index tell us about the S&PSOO? Where are the rallies in India and Australia positioned relative to the DJIA? Do they lead or lag the S&PSOO?

Does the TSX lead the S&PSOO? Yes. Who leads the TSX? (Often, the Dax.) What market leads at major tops and does it lead or lag at bottoms?

The list of questions should never end. You can never stop thinking or challenging yourself. If this is right, then that, too, must make

sense in your chart work. What am I missing? Does the cyde work complement or contradict your assumptions? If you sit before your screen thinking about your volatility band position and divergence signal alone, you’ll be gone within your first decade in today’s envi- ronment. But you can see the 2-by-4 wind-up that will hit you before

IV. Problem-Solving Skills

it actually happens. Technical Analysis is not about the squiggles. Those are only the tools we use to unlock the world’s greatest puzzles on an ever-changing stage.

My other piece of advice: Never stop leaming. If you never make any mistakes, you are not trying hard enough to leam.

CHAPTER 8

Gann Rules That 1 Regret Breaking, Yet Survived to Tell

Trading is as much about knowing your own strengths and weak- nesses as it is about knowing the markets. Paul Tudor Jones was quoted in an interview saying his toughest year was 2OI7. Many of us need market swings; they are our way of entering a position and managing the risk.

In Appendix H you will find the P&L beginnings of Paul Tudor Jones’s Tudor Futures Fund. These records for the birth of a me- ga-fund make a wonderful example of what to expect. You better go for it. You will fall on your face a couple times in the beginning and lose your largest investor. It is even harder when you start with less than $2S,OOO. No one will take you seriously until you cross over the $I2S,OOO line. But keep your focus and make a quick recovery if you hit a bump on the road. 1 used Paul Tudor Jones’s early track record as my incentive and dream. But my dream died on 9/II. 1 struggled to hold long positions in the 5&P SOO for fear of an event. Other futures markets were no issue after working with a horse whisperer for about ten years, but long 5&PSOO... they call it PTSD.

The best way to teach someone is not by recalling all the wonderful things you have done, but by reviewing how you survived all the stupid things you should not have done in the first place!

George Lane in his day was a major floor trader in the Com markets. He taught me the art of scalping, which complements a position trader because you know how to back into a better-leveraged position by just being able to read price action into the smallest fractal. Gann

wrote, “Unless you know the greatest as well as the least movement, you cannot do accurate forecasting.” ' He understood the nature of fractals. Today algorithm traders believe this cannot be done any more. 1 would disagree.

Gann had big drawdowns... and an iron stomach it seems. Tunnel Thru The Air allows Kennelworth to hold a good gain nearly back to his entry level. Page 9O reports Kennelworth buys July Cotton at I3.7O. Page 94 July cotton has rallied to I4.8O. Then Cotton falls back to I3.7S on p. 94. They hold their positions. Then Cotton rallies on page 96 to IS.4O with a prediction of I7-cent Cotton. At I6 they finally raise their stop (p. IO3). 1 would have been out of that trade and back in on the pullback. You cannot change the rhythm you are comfortable trading with after years of repeating successful pattems. You must find your own tolerances and comfort zone. Stay true to yourself. The trade in Tunnel tells me Gann had some wild swings he sat on before raising stops.

A. HOW TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT LEVERAGE AND STOP PLACEMENT

The universal questions are always the same: Where do you put stop placement, how do you determine position size or correct leverage, what are the targets, and where do you set execution levels?

8. Gann Rules That 1 Regret Breaking—Yet Survived to Tell 79

For all the stupid things 1 may do, 1 never violate Figure 8.2—not in either of my accounts for short-term scalping, nor in my account for longer-horizon position trading that must be held with a different firm. That spreadsheet is etched in my brain for all the markets 1 trade. Stops, risk ratios, leverage—all come from this table after the Fi- bonacci confluence zones and Gann Wheels are mapped on the chart.

The capital allocation must be revised and kept current daily in cell “O2.’ The left-side is just the dollar value for x contracts. The right-side is where all the answers are residing. A spread between confluence zones of 8.5 handles (8.SO) in the 5&PSOO contract is a risk of 0.SI% with 3 contracts in cell ‘QI9.’ Willing to risk 5% means 3O contracts for an account as defined in cell ‘O2.’ The target should be at least 26 5&P SOO handles in your favor. That way for every dollar at risk it should eam $3. This table is why 1 have survived thirty years trading futures markets. Your retums dramatically increase when you add Time cydes with accurate price projections. But to use this table you must first have an accurate price projection method.

Spend as much time evaluating where the market should not go as you do for the targets. Stops in very short horizon can be placed on the outside of the Gann/Fibonacci confluence zones. To manage positions with a longer horizon you must know your market’s daily trading range and use the confluence that makes sense. Usually it is two Fibonacci confluence zones away. There comes a point where the stop is too wide for the retum. Stay out and find a better win/loss ratio.

B. GANN TRADING RULES

Read 4S- Years in Wall Street and How to Make Profits Trading in Com- modities by Gann for many of his rules, but here is a quick summary.

(My comments in parentheses.)

1. When in doubt, get out, and don’t get in when in doubt.

2. Always use Market orders, never use Limits. (Agreed.)

3. Accumulate a surplus. After you have made a series of successful trades, put some money into a surplus account to be used only in an emergency or time of panic. (This was a George Lane rule as well. 1 follow this religiously.)

4. Don’t have losses due to overtrading.

5. Don’t have uncontrolled losses because there are no stops.

6. Never trade more than IO% of capital (Guilty in bear markets.)

7. A lack of knowledge about what you are trading can result in losses.

8. Don’t buy on a tip.

9. Don’t buy on hope.

IO. Don’t trade against the trend. (Guilty. 1 do it all the time.)

II. Buy at single, double, triple bottoms. (Disagree. Buy or sell on lower volume for a second test or divergence.)

I2. Buy or sell on percentages. (1 do not think Gann’s simple per- centages offer sufficient risk management for today’s markets. Use Fibonacci confluence and Gann Wheel confluence levels.)

I3. Buy or sell on 3-weeks’ advance or dedine. (Disagree.)

I4. Markets moves in sections or waves. (Gann is dearly aware of R. N. Elliott.)

IS. Buy or sell on 5- to 7-point moves. (Strongly disagree.)

I6. Volume of sales.

I7. Time factor or period is most important. (Agree.)

I8. Market over-balance. (It can stay that way a long time. Not much value until it breaks.)

---

8O V. Trading Rules and Risk Management

I9. A change in trend often occurs before holidays. (True.)

2O. Safest buy or sell is after the trend reversal and a secondary re- action has occurred. (TRUE!)

2I.In strong trends, reactions only last two days. (Never counted.)

22. Never buy just to get a dividend. (1 am not a stock investor, but it makes sense.)

23. Never average a loss. (Very true.)

24. Never get out of the market just because you have lost patience.

2S. Avoid getting in and out of the market too often.

26. Avoid taking small profits and big losses. (Agreed.)

27. Never cancel a stop loss order after you have placed it. (Agreed.)

28. Be just as willing to sell short as to buy. (Agreed.)

29. Be careful about pyramiding at the wrong time. (This one is interesting because Gann reverse pyramids. Gann describes his pyramiding in Course Ten of the Stock Course, “Method for Trading with the Night Chart.” Gann’s first position is 50%, then half as much again. Most traders today follow 3O%, 50%, 2O%. 1 do not pyramid, but treat each additional leg as its own separate trade. The trades just happen to be in the same contract.)

3O. Never hedge. (Agreed. Scalping with a different firm against a position trade 1 do not view as a hedge. They are separate en- tities. The accountant views it as a hedge.)

3I. Never change your position in the market without good reason.

32. Avoid increasing your trading after a long period of successes. (This is a great one and requires tremendous discipline. Soon as you change...you get whapped. One bad overleveraged trade kills many good ones.)

33. Safety of capital comes first. (Yes! This is paramount.)

34. Protect your profits. (Seems we have a different approach about

when to move stops. 1 might add, Never use a percentage trailing stop. Know the confluence zones you cannot break through.)

3S. Leave the money part out of the discussion. (Gann means don’t trade on expectations of making x. That can never dictate a target or a reason to enter a position.)

36. Action, not delay, makes money in Wall Street. (Agree. Analysis paralysis is lethal.)

37- Margin calls should be cashed out immediately. (Fortunately, 1 have never had a margin call.)

38. Average trader does not want to know or see the truth. (Gann means you are married to your opinion and can only see that opinion. True.)

39. Human element is the greatest weakness. (How true; 1 am so

guilty!) The Stock Market Course adds additional rules:

4O. You should keep out of slow trading markets. (This is one rule 1 deeply regret not following. Here is where Elliott pattems entrap or sucker you in when you should not be in. 1 would add to this the fear of being left out. It makes you establish positions too early when you know it is too early.)

4I. Markets have cross-currents. (Gann means some rally as others dedine. We know that, but never hedge one against the other as a private trader.)

42. Low priced stocks are disappointing. (1 wish 1 had a nickel for every time a dient asked me about a scavenger-fish bottom hugging stock. Opportunity loss as capital is trapped on the train to nowhere.)

43. Uptrends must make higher tops and higher bottoms.

---

8. Gann Rules That 1 Regret Breaking—Yet Survived to Tell 8I

44. Downtrends must make lower tops and lower bottoms. (1 will add, Be very aware the 5&PSOO often makes expanded flat tops that allow wave ‘C’ to exceed an old swing high. That’s how it develops a series of first waves down and second waves up. 1 think this one could mislead a trader.)

4S. Buy when stock crosses former tops or a series of tops in a weekly chart. (That is the “Turtle Trader” method. Do this intraday in 5&PSOO futures, and you will be a dead trader due to normal volatility. Be aware of normal daily ranges in your market.)

46. You must have courage to act. (Not a problem.)

47. After you acquire knowledge you will need to learn PATIENCE. (Note to self... re-read No. 47 EVERY DAY!)

48. Safest selling point...Sell on a secondary rally after the stock has broken the previous bottoms of several weeks or has broken the bottom of the last reaction. (This is the money maker. See ‘Form Reading’ in the Stock course.)

49. Buy/sell at breakaway points. (Agreed. 1 will add this: In a meltdown environment you must be fully positioned in futures before the first limit down. Don’t ever add after the market reopens activating the new limit down parameters. Why? Self-preservation in ripcord reversals back up. You have time to react and survive when many have devastating losses.)

so. “M M” or 4-Top Formation. Gann tells us to sell short when stocks break the second ‘V’ of the last M.

SI. Always be aware of the length of the strongest bar in the trend. When the reverse trend produces a strong bar longer than the longest bar in the prior trend, the prior trend is over. (1 am para- phrasing this one. Gann does not mean it is the end of the uptrend or intermediate trend, but that it is the end as far as trades are

concemed to the upside. This should be studied in the first break of the I929 crash. There was an early waming. One bar down off the top was longer than in the entire uptrend. Read The Day the Bubble Burst: A Social History of the Wall Street Crash of 7929.7 It is the best read on the subject and contains all the juicy meetings and stories of the people who could have attempted to stop it but could not. Find out which steel tycoon’s wife triggered the first selloff while crossing the Atlantic. She knew that when waiters were talking stocks it was time to sell. The wire instructions to sell all of her stock holdings caused a panic run of orders from the first-dass passengers onboard. Smart lady!)

S2. This last point from Course Ten of the Stock Course “Method for Trading with the Night Chart” is absolutely critical. Gann writes, “You must have machine-like action in order to succeed, and buy or sell according to the rules, regardless of what you... hope.”

S3. Can 1 add a new one just defined in November of 2OI8? Don’t ever do what 1 just did! My average position size is not a one-lot in the 5&P or Nasdaq futures, but 1 always keep the default order size to ‘1’ as 1 used to have a cat in my office that had a knack of pressing the order key if he pounced on the table. Recently the fact that my default was still set to the minimum

2. By Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts (Penguin Books, I98O). The book is out-of-print, but it can be found. And, good news! It’s available on Amazon as a Kindle offering for the grand total of $8.79. That will change when you guys start dicking. But you do want to read this book.

saved me big time. Until this incident occurred 1 used to use one keyboard for both my analysis computer and my trading/ execution computer. On this day my eye suddenly caught a po- sition bar flashing red on an open position in the Nasdag futures. 1 was working on this book. 1 didn’t have any open positions! Simple. Cover at the market ASAP and then figure out what happened. Right? Wrong! One Nasdaq futures contract was sold at 6,S3O.2S and filled on November 23, 2OI8 at precisely OI:I4:49 PM. The order to offset at OI:IS:32 PM was declined. Why?! The message read: “Denied—Markets Closed for Holidays.” Say what?!

This was Friday aftemoon and the CME dosed II seconds after this fill until Sunday night for the Thanksgiving holiday. We were on the shortened holiday schedule. Even a one-lot in the Nasdaq can mean thousands. Great! The good news is everything is frozen. 1 don’t have to worry 1 cannot enter a stop. The bad news, everything is frozen for the next S3 hours! 1 am trapped. 1 never carry positions over holidays. If all hell breaks out 1’m Okay. But perhaps we are poised to hear about a Trade agreement between China and the USA. It would be very Trump-like to break such news over a holiday. Gulp. That would be ugly. Plus, 1 know the seasonal trend is against me. The market often sells off into this holiday and rebounds sharply on the reopen. None of this looks good.

What happens? When the market is about to reopen my finger is poised over the “panic” button. Boom. Figure 8.3 records on Sunday, November 2S, 2OI8 precisely at O6:OO:IS PM, that the Globex open has accepted my order to dump this stray orphan contract. The fill? Incredibly... S3 hours later, the order is filled at the price of 6,S3S—

at-the-market. The loss was a grand total of -$96.2O. Why did it take me IS seconds to hit the panic button to offset? 1 needed to see some stability before 1 hit the button as the immediate first few seconds on the open were untradeable. The next moming showed Nasdaq had rallied all night and was up IIS handles. Lessons leamed. Use separate keyboards between your analysis computer and your exe- cution computer. Always keep the default order size to the minimum. Always cover a mistake as soon as you can—don’t try to tum it into a position. Keep your cool in the event that this is an actual emergency and keep your seat belt and tray firmly fastened. 1’ll never know how my switch changed my keyboard over to the trading execution computer. 1 was typing within Chapter 23 that covers aspects and angles that use some special keys when it happened. As George Lane wamed, if you are a trader, “shit is going to happen to you.” In time you will have a long list of things that go bump in the night like this. Just stay cool; panic cannot change the situation.

Does Gann ever break his own trading rules? Absolutely. Course Four, (Stocks), The Basis of My Forecasting, tum to “Two 4S° Angles from the Same Bottom.” The chart is “Form #8.” The angle it marks ‘Buy’ violates several of Gann’s rules. ‘Buy’ is against the trend. The dedine contains longer bars than those shown in the prior move up, another violation. Good traders have guidelines. Form #8 shows an Elliott five-wave pattem dedine from the upper 4S° angle to the bottom 4S° angle. Gann was likely right for a counter-trend bounce. {Fig. 8.3}

Forgive me if 1 update Gann’s original list with a few more for current times.

1. Life is not fair; get over it.

8. Gann Rules That 1 Regret Breaking—Yet Survived to Tell

2. World markets care little for your self-esteem. You must succeed to find inner peace. That will only come from hard work. 3. If you think your teacher is tough... wait until you face world

markets.

4. Never forget you are one reckless trade away from trading places

5. When you mess up, it was no one’s fault. Own it. Leam from the opportunity you were given. When you lose don’t lose the lesson. 6. Your school may have done away with winners and losers, but life has not. The proof is in your balance sheet and equity curve graph.

Freemasonry, like all other sciences, is a system of progression. Something more ts required to constitute a bright Mason than a knowledge of the elements of the craft. A carpenter may know the tools, and have acquired some dexterity in their practical use: but this will

CHAPTER 9

Down the Rabbit Hole

<span id="chapter-9-a"></span>

A. AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY OF GANN ANALYSIS

You are in good company. Alumni before you indude: Timaeus, Plato, Aristotle, Eudid, Pythagoras, Nicomachus, Iamblichus, Al-Kindi, Al- Khwarizmi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna), Hildegard of Bingen, Ibn Arabi, Thomas Aquinas, Dante, and Kepler. No pressure on my shoulders. What, are you kidding? 1 feel tremendous pressure to get ‘it’ right. How do 1 summarize twenty years of work and keep it on a meaningful track so at the end you are as much in awe of Gann analysis as lam? How do 1 show the depth of the subject and not tum you off in the process? Goodness, this is a formidable and humbling task at hand.

In my private efforts to try and connect the dots, 1 chased down so many rabbit holes associated with Gann, that 1 can no longer count them all. But there is a reason why 1 did this.

The many chases and many dead ends cannot be counted because as our understanding grows they merge to become one. My graphic representation in Figure 9.1, which is inspired by Robert Fludd’s ‘Utriusque Cosmi, is a summary of what lies ahead. All roads must be explored, but they all lead us to the same place of understanding, regardless of where you began. The four disciplines of study are: Harmonics, Geometry, Astronomy, and Numerology. Numerology is not in my chart as it really fits in the center.

Gann enthusiasts are driven by the quest for knowledge that extends far beyond the markets. However, be cautious on this joumey lest you fall into a trap and never come out again. The Dalai Lama offered advice during a lecture in Paris: “For us, whether we are teachers or students, it is very important to use the teachings in order to transform our mind—and not in order to increase our book knowledge.”

The four disciplines will merge into a single elegant simplicity. It is so easy to get trapped and weighed down with the burden of theo- retical knowledge. Knowing when to stop chasing a rabbit down its hole is important. When the light comes on, stop. The Dalai Lama said that true knowing is understanding; it is not the accumulation of facts.

The balance is a difficult one. There must be sufficient “meat” to offer proof that your quest was sincere.

The Dalai Lama went one step further to say that the struggle and goal is to free oneself from knowledge. 1 had to think hard on that one. My understanding now is that knowledge can be used to separate yourself from all that is around you. Once you know, it is necessary to become free of it. This explains my sense of relief that this book is finally being written. It is a feeling of freedom from a burden 1 have carried much too long.

“Leaming” as was said in the Tao Te Ching by Lao-Tzu, “consists in increasing our stock of knowledge every day. Practicing Tao consists in decreasing it.”

{ 87}

All this may be summarized in Krishnamurti’s statement that it is only when thought ceases that there is wisdom and that thought can cease only when there is an end to the process of accumulation.

The accumulation phase has taken me from the New York Library to Cairo, and many places in between, as it did Gann. All along the joumey 1 felt 1 was accompanied by Gann himself with every step. How often 1 would step off the path only to be given a tidbit dropped in my lap in an unexpected way that would steer me back on course. You see, it is extremely important to know this: to understand Gann Analysis, we must understand where Gann originally received his training and understanding. What is the “it” he was applying? If you believe you can start with Gann’s charts alone, you have lost your way before you have even begun your quest.

Gann knew that all these individual disciplines merged as an el- oquent model of conversions. For example:

1. Music frequencies are at the root of Divisional Harmonic Geometry.

2. Astronomical Angles can be converted into Market Price pivot points.

3. Geometric proportion defines balance angles through space, or what Gann called the balance in Price and Time.

There are three kinds of ratios: Arithmetic ratios, Geometric ratios, and Frequency ratios. Of these, the latter is of greatest importance.

How did a woman, forbidden to be taught by, or enter the order of Freemasons, learn what to study? 1 had to do this the hard way, on my own.

Gann was a 33rd Degree Freemason. He had to have attained the 33rd Degree because in his suitcase are all the symbols of a Freemason

Lodge (Appendix G). The 33rd Degree means one is head or the Commander of a Lodge. His Lodge in Brooklyn dosed. These items, upon his passing, were to have been bumt or destroyed by other brothers of the Lodge. But he kept them to be passed on to Elinor Smith in a suitcase that had his Freemason 32nd Degree Jewel and Master Mason Apron, and numerous symbols of a Freemason’s Lodge, induding items of sacred passage few ever see.

The Freemasons are not the only ones with this knowledge. 1 found of value the Rosicrucian books—the ancient mystical Order Rosae Crucis. 1 leamed how to search hidden files in monasteries that were indexed only by a numeric coded order. 1 travelled to Samos, Greece, and then the Athens University History Museum in Athens beneath the Acropolis to study rare books. Important lessons were leamed in Dwarka, India. The lessons of numerology and color in Lhasa, Tibet. Then there is Egypt, and truly referenced in present tense. So much more to learn and see. 1 sat (and sneezed a lot) before old dusty books whose book mites and mold made my asthma flare up (two hospital emergencies). The harder 1 studied the more material to learn came my way.

1 was on my own, but people are wonderfully gracious to those seeking help as an apprentice. 1 did not realize that 1 had had tre- mendous training already for the joumey. My mother was from Finland and my grandmother was an accomplished musician who immigrated when my mother was young. She was the concert pianist for the Philadelphia Philharmonic Orchestra. The extensive training in music theory that was required of me when 1 was young certainly helped. Another key, my birth sumame is not “Brown.” It isa German name. My father was a theoretical physicist. My mother married an Englishman when 1 was four years old. My stepfather changed my

---

9. Down the Rabbit Hole 89

name to his as my German name was so unacceptable to him. This was only a decade after W WII and my name haunted the relationship with my stepfather until his passing. So, 1 have the British name Brown ... but with German-Finnish genes and a strange genetic connection and aptitude for physics and mathematics. Somehow all these lost fields of interest of my past pulled together as the ideal union of skills needed to study Gann.

People assumed 1 must have a degree in math or physics; 1 do not. 1 left the University of Toronto to study Photographic Technology at Ryerson University in Toronto. 1 wanted to work for Kodak, and it was a smart marketing plan. 1 was hired straight from school and trained by the best photographers and technicians in America about film technologies through to the finished graphic production processes. Kodak taught me to read DlogE sensitometric curves to an accuracy within a 2-degree slope change. (DlogE is Density Log Exposure curves.) 1 became Kodak’s technical advisor for the Na- tional Geographic Society and for NASA’s Jet Propulsion Labs in Califomia. That would lead to becoming brand manager for Kodak’s Professional Color Films. But our division lost the battle to launch our invention—the digital camera. 1 left the company late in I987 for Wall Street. Believe me, it was never ‘Easy Street’ as George Lane had titled his book.

1 was told by my bosses at Kodak that 1 had a gift for taking very complex systems and boiling them down to a comprehensive model. ve never been more tested in this regard than now. It is my hope this immense collection of subjects flows easily for you and answers some of your questions about why so many different fields of study intertwine along Gann’s path.

The beginnings were hard. One can move from topic to topic and

not fully understand. Then that leads you to ten more topics, which in tum leads to even more branches and tributaries, which leads further to the endless maze of rabbit holes. What 1 did during the phase of bewilderment was to save folders of what seemed to be like topics until 1 could connect the dots and find a key to help me. While there were moments when 1 could begin to grasp that something much bigger was going on, the ‘eureka’ moment did not occur for me until 1 began to work on the contents of Gann’s suitcase and met Luther J. Jensen and his writings.

It took considerable time just to put all the papers in order as Elinor was in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease and had somehow managed to scramble what 1 am sure had once been neat piles of notes. She also, or so 1 first thought, put crayon markings on the notes. As you will find out later these markings were Gann’s. Elinor Smith was Gann’s pilot and was dearly Gann’s go-to person for questions relating to math. She was an aviator, and it made sense to me that she would have had this role.

See Appendix E.

* A maroon colored book of L. J. Jensen, Astro-Economic Interpretation: A Mundane Astrology Notebook. Fundamentals of Economic Forecasting.

The Astrological Bulletina contained a regular contribution about quarterly business conditions and cydes written by Luther J. Jensen. In I93I he opened the Kansas City Bureau of Economic Research. The firm was dosed after Gann’s death, making me and others suspect this was a firm set up entirely to support Gann’s research and under his payroll. Jensen was then employed by B. C. Christopher and Company in New York from I9S7 until I97I when he retired. Jensen was dearly trained and extremely proficient in the methods of Gann. The fact that Gann saved his column for Elinor is a dear statement Jensen had it right in Gann’s eyes. Sometimes 1 wondered if some of the columns were written by Gann himself because phrasing was

---

9. Down the Rabbit Hole 9I

often identical to contents in Gann’s own books. 1’ll never know, but the gift was the fact Jensen wrote in plain speech and 1 could finally connect the most difficult concepts, which had been giving me the greatest headaches.

While 1 understood and studied Jerome Baumring’s material, 1 don’t think he did a very good job of moving beyond the breadth of back- ground studies we learn in Canadian grade schools. Perhaps he did, and the material that remains available to us is incomplete or lost. But Baumring is not the key that unlocks the doors to Gann’s methods. The Julius Nirenstein Lecture Notes of I986 are more logically de- veloped and documented. But you need a fuller knowledge of Gann analysis before you can find what few small crumbs are contained in these notes that pertain specifically to Gann. They were more of a confirmation that 1 was on the right track. 1 find it interesting that the most important field of study, harmonics, is the one often left without much substance. 1 think Brad Stewart knew this when he arranged a translation of Hans Kayser’s Textbook of Harmonics. These are ex- tremely interesting once you are at my level of music theory and have an understanding of the Law of Vibration. But these books arrived after 1 had most of my dimensional layers in place for the Law of Vi- bration. Kayser is not my source. My sources and names are in this book and the best are not of this century.

What are the most useful resources 1 studied to learn about Gann? 1 would suggest these in this order as a start, and it is my hope that public opinion will add this new book to the list someday.

1. W. D. Gann, “Master Commodities Course.”

2. Anything you can get your hands on by Luther J. Jensen.

3. Gann’s Coffee Letter.

4. Gann’s Book Tunnel Thru The Air. (You need to know something

first to read this book. It is written with the intent you will decode it. It is all code. 1 will help you in this regard, so you can see the pattems of imbedded references. 1 hate methods written as an encryption code; therefore 1 am nota fan of this book. However, you will see me reference TTTA often.)

5. Religious works: The Bible, The Torah, The Holy Qu’ran. These

works teach us there is a Higher Order, the Freemasons would say a “One” Supreme Engineer of all things in creation. This is why the Freemason’s accept all faiths provided the faith be- lieves in the “One.” You cannot study Gann and not come away without a sense of awe that you are leaming about something much bigger than markets.

Time in the Bible is given to us by the numbers that reference people’s ages, when they had a son, and their ages at passing. The numbers become angles and arc durations in time. 1 will explain much later.

6. Gann states his source: “1 have not only put in years of labor in the

regular way, but 1 spent nine months working night and day in the old Astor Library and in the British Museum in London pouring over ancient books on mathematics and geometry...” Milwaukee Sentinel Magazine, “Sees the Kaiser Shot While Trying to Flee His Prison,” January 5, I9I9.

* The Astor Library is now part of The New York Public Library Archives. To get access to the collection, you require authori- zation and referrals, a documented research project, and inter- national sponsorship. (IFTA). Materials are not circulated. (It is worth the effort however.)

* British Museum—Gann was interested in the surveys for the Great Pyramid of Giza and the name Eudoxus. Eudoxus is men-

tioned in a papyrus. His name will be connected to the Hermetic Astrology of Ancient Egypt. Gann was also in London to access long data records of Wheat prices.

* British Library—When you request a Library card they will tell you they have nothing on Astronomical Geometry if you state that is your field of interest on the application. Mathematics is not well indexed. You must know the title... or a Professor at Oxford University to help sponsor your research project.

7. Max Heindel, Simplified Scientific Astrology, still available from

The Rosicrucian Fellowship, Oceanside, Califomia, USA. This book was required reading in the late I8OOs/early I9OOs by American Scottish rite Freemasons. It shows that planet movements were commonly referred to as natural vibrations or the Law of Vibration. You are about to discover that there is much more to it than just the bodies orbiting in our solar system. Gann’s “Time Factors” are astronomical events.

8. Brad Cowen’s book, Pentagonal Time Cyde Theory (This is not

a comment of omission about any other works he may have; 1 have not seen others except the Commodity course.) When 1 needed an altemate copy of Gann’s Commodity course, 1 pur- chased Brad Cowen’s version. Being dyslexic, 1 had a very hard time with the brown speckled paper he used and the large pro- tective stamps on just about every other page.

9. The one author 1 have always recommended is Patrick Mikula.

He has spent much time in Gann’s books. We both agree John Gann’s percentages were used as a camouflage net to hide Gann’s real chart references in How To Make Profits Trading in Commodities. All references to work by John Gann should be ignored.

1 believed it was important to remain independent, so 1 am not part of any Gann group. We are silent introverts in general 1 suspect, and when independent researchers have similar findings, it only helps you see there must be seeds of truth within our work. There comes that moment when you get it, and that moment is breathtaking. One begins to feel very small indeed within the bigger picture.

A book such as this takes great courage as it covers so many disci- plines. Someone will find something they wish to challenge. Excellent! This work is offered with the sincere wish others will move this body of study forward. For too long the study of Gann has been caught in a loop where new students find themselves always at the beginning. This is an honest and deep effort to stop this endless trend. 1 encourage you to reach beyond my level of understanding.

Software: Nearly all my charts in the book were created using Optuma—Gann Edition. That is my primary software for all my analysis work. However, my opinion is not objective towards this product. During the development of this book 1 had to document numerous software problems. 1 have done likewise since 2OO4. When 1 am providing specifications for product solutions to one vendor, 1 do not share the same information with other vendors. You cannot if you wish to continue the dialogue.

1 was in a direct dialogue to define corrections and enhancements with Mathew Verdouw of Optuma (formerly Market-Analyst). Only after such corrections would you be able to duplicate my results for your own evaluation. Without software Gann methods cannot be applied in an institutional environment needing so many calculations in numerous markets. Further enhancements were made when the features were released to the Gann community as Beta testers. The Gann Wheels were entirely redesigned when 1 gave Mathew an

early version of the Hexagon Wheel described in Chapter 22 and then demonstrated privately for him the methods. Understanding the Hexagon Wheel also allowed for a horizontal Hex projection di- rectly on the price data, making it possible for us to apply the Hexagon to trine markets and stop the assumption of many that all markets track to the Square of Nine because there was no other option in the software. (We will visit how to tell the difference between trine and sguare resonating markets in Chapter II.) Many of us knew this software had serious issues in the Gann edition, but to give details of how to fix the software would mean disdosing how Gann made the calculations. Those of us who knew never stepped forward to define the solutions and the vendor could not do so on their own. Thus the problems were present for over a decade. 1 had painted myself into a comer as 1 needed software to demonstrate the steps for you in this book. It forced my hand to finally spell out all the needed features and steps in detail. Market-Analyst invested con- siderable resources to help us. They in tum offered our industry a more marketable product that would translate into sales. That is a good exchange. Other areas 1 brought to their attention were math errors in the geometric time relationships of the squaring tools. If you suspected that the Square of the Range did not work, you were correct. The Number Searcher tool had a serious flaw as it could not recognize that the price bottom of a price bar at the historic market high was not what we define as a pivot low and vice-versa for price highs on the last bar at the bottom of a price swing was not a market ‘high.’ Test every feature you wish to use. Does the feature do what you would expect? Some changes miss the mark in execution because the programmer does not have the understanding we have. Do not assume your vendor has it right as the expert. They do not manage a

portfolio or have to time dient investments. Check your work again when a new release comes out. Market-Analyst has a long history of making a change that impacts your existing charts globally. The changes are not always correct nor desired. 1 asked for a way to easily plot square calendar day counting calculations. Beta testers enhanced it further by making the feature a user-defined formula. The point is that vendors are not the experts in specialized technical analysis methodology. Keep that in mind when you attend seminars offered by a vendor.

The Pythagorean overlay for the Square of Nine and Hexagon Wheels were absorbed into the product when the specifications were given to them in the process of writing this book. The U.5. Treasury Square of Nine formula was given to Mathew for the retum of Gann’s Master Apron which 1 had once offered as a gift. But when the London Freemasons told me the collection must stay intact, a difficult process began for me to correct my error and to provide an acceptable answer to the question, “What’s in it for me?’ Wall Street is indeed an inter- esting exchange of give-and-take on so many levels. Everything has a bid and ask. Nothing is free. Every feature you have available to you likely has a story behind it. Someone likely had to weigh their risks and benefits. The Treasury formula described for you later, and all the 5&P sectors and DJIA stock charts you receive as template workbooks at start-up came from that exchange for the Apron, but 1 would have sold my soul to get Gann’s Master Apron back. Well, 1 might not have been willing to reveal the Wheel applications back then. It is just the nature of our crazy business. 1 resorted to pressure when 1 was writing Fibonacci Analysis. The software company simply could not grasp that they did everything backwards and 1 had struggled for nearly six years over this one. A threatening paragraph was re-

vealed in the draft manuscript with the fact Bloomberg would be the publisher. When the program was then corrected 1 removed the de- tailed examples of ‘how not to do it’ from my Fibonacci Analysis book before it was sent on for final typeset. We moved forward in a very interesting relationship as two facing Samurais with our hands resting on the sheaths of undrawn swords. It remains so today. Is this why 1 love being a student of Korean Swordsmanship? 1 thought it was fun and required of any cool, well-trained Jedi at first. However, my wood sword was replaced with one that could do serious damage and 1 discovered training in attention to detail, balance, cadence, rhythm, intense focus, and rapid risk assessment with a lethal sword applied key lessons of survival thinking for trading! Interested? Start with the Google search term, ‘Korean Hwarang Warriors.’ 1 am a student of a 9th Degree Grandmaster. It is a very great honor if you are ac- cepted to be a student by a Grandmaster in your country.

This book also contains charts from Timing Solution. 1 use it for astronomical event testing. Awesome! The astronomical features and capabilities of Timing Solution are brilliant, broad, and essential for testing Time Factors. Timing Solution software is not easy to use, but know that they have exceptional rapid support when needed. 1 then move these tested cyde events over to Optuma because in my opinion Optuma displays astronomical events in a much better manner for traders within charts. Another way 1 use Timing Solution software is for harmonic cydes with overtones. All Time Factors you test can be used to develop your own complex formulas to use independently or in their neural net model features. The product has no challengers for model construction and testing. But the strength of this platform is the astronomical study of cydes. The trading platforms 1 monitor are TradeStation and Interactive Brokers. Both are fine platforms.

Without the continual support and efforts to move our analysis methods forward by our software vendors, our industry would not be as advanced as it is today. Our success goes hand-in-hand with theirs... though the more your expertise grows through market and trading experience, the more challenging the relationship with your vendor may become. Pick your battles carefully and keep in mind that you are helping everyone else in our industry, too, when things get heated. Okay, ready? Fasten your seat belt! Our joumey begins in ancient Egypt.

B. THE EGYPTIAN AND MESOPOTAMIAN CALENDAR BEGINS IN TAURUS, NOT ARIES

Westem academicians used to make us believe most of the sciences originated from the Greeks. But we know now that Pythagoras (S8O-SOO B.C.E.) studied for nearly twenty years in Egypt, Plato studied in Egypt, as did Aristotle, Eudid, and others we recognize today as the great thinkers of our past. The contributions originating from Egypt had infiltrated the Greeks long before the Ptolemaic Dynasty of 323 B.C. to 3O B.c. It was not until the Ptolemaic Dynasty and the building of Alexandria that Greek was spoken as a primary language. But we will cross that bridge another time. 1 referenced the work of Dr. Okasha El-Daly of Oxford University in my book, Fi- bonacci Analysis. Dr. El-Daly told me over dinner one night in Egypt that he had found references to Pythagoras’s years of study on ancient papyrus. He also found in the dusty basement of the British Museum countless uncategorized papyrus. One papyrus has a reference to a tomb chamber that was built in the Pyramid of Menkaure (the smallest of the three) in preparation for Pythagoras’s death. He was dearly held in high regard in Egypt.

We always say in our industry, “Follow the money trail.” When it comes to the disciplines for the study of Gann Analysis, same concept, but expressed a little differently: “Where did they learn it from or from whom?” One-day Nikki Jones shocked me on the phone. She said she did not care what was in Gann’s suitcase, she asked, “How did you get it?” She was deeply disappointed when 1 told her the suitcase passed to my hands from Elinor Smith. Nikki explained how she had tried to meet up with Elinor for many years. The follow-up emails between us are in Appendix A.

About a mile and a half southeast of Dendera, Egypt is a temple complex. It is a large complex and was used to house an item of great interest to Gann analysts—that is until the French stole it in I82O. But now the Hathor temple of Dendera, where the circular Zodiac of Dendara (also Dendera) was on the ceiling on the eastem side of the building is just a fake plaster cast of the original and hearing of further damage adds insult to injury. This building complex is the only one that has references to Cleopatra. Where did the Zodiac go? At the time of the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt in I799, the in- vaders drew the first line drawings of the circular Zodiac of Dendara, and that triggered the interest in Europe. The theft was done by the Frenchman Vivant Denon who became the curator of the French Louvre Museum. The circular Zodiac of Dendara remains there today.

A zodiac is how we subdivide the horizon line before us. There are two different planes people use because the Earth is tilted on its axis. We will only need one; figuring out where we live on a sphere is called Positional Astronomy. The horizon line of the sky is depart- mentalized into units of 3O-degree segments. Each segment is defined by its own symbol called a Sign.

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

Gann makes frequent note of his scientific manner of application. It really needs another name. For years 1 would just use “Astronomy,” but the ancients’ name is more appropriate, Astro-Sciences. Gann himself made a strong statement of the shortcomings of modem-day westem astrologers:

9. Down the Rabbit Hole

Pepi (22SO B.c.E.). There are conflicts regarding the age, but not about its significance. What is important for you to know is the Egyptians held an intimate relationship between astronomy and music. As- tronomy is time defined by the heart beats of the planets and other bodies in the heavens. That will take some explaining. We will get there. Music contains the mathematics used to explain the relationships within astronomy. This fundamental connection is inseparable from all aspects of ancient Egyptian life and thinking.

The Zodiac of Dendara in Figure 9.3a and 9.3b is the only known circular representation of the five planets (stars) of the ancient world with the constellations as seen from Egypt. The goddesses of the four cardinal points (at 9O degrees, N, 5, E, and West), are joined by four pairs of falcon-head divinities. The constellations are surrounded by thirty-six decans shown as standing divinities walking in an anti- dockwise direction. Decans serve as internal divisors of time and the fact there are thirty-six is what we need to take away from this work. The Ancient Egyptians divided a thirty-day month into thirds. The ten-day periods were tied to dusters of fixed stars, and it is these star groups that are the “decans.” All thirty-six decans were given names.

The number 36 is in the number set 9, I8, 36, 72, I44.... As we cover the four disciplines of harmonics, geometry, numerology, and astronomy, you will see these same numbers and ratios reappear in different discussions over and over again. They are important.

The Ancient Egyptian scholars focused not only on the ediptic plane, but on the diumal rotation of the movement of the decans across the sky. This is the root of what became the twelve houses.

The Zodiac of Dendara is divided into three: the ring of the ediptic, which is an inner cirde, the zodiacal constellations in a middle cirde surrounding the first, and the constellations of the North and South

that become the outer cirde endosing the two inner ones. The ratio 3:2 has great significance. For now, just know that the name of this ratio is the “Perfect Fifth.”

It is possible the Egyptians were influenced by the Mesopotamians, but scholars agree most signs of the Zodiac of Dendara are Egyptian. The Crab (Cancer), the Lion (Leo), and the Scales (Libra) are without challenge Egyptian. (Scales measure our good deeds at the time of judgment.) Aquarius is the sign for the god Hapi of the Nile. The Nile marked the seasons of the year. The flooding of the Nile is the start of the new year from mid-July to mid-November. Germination time is from mid-November to mid-March. The time of drought is from mid-March to mid-July. Each month begins at the start of the New Moon. The decans mark the divisions of the seasons. There are four months in the three different seasons of the year. This ratio of 4:3 is called the “Perfect Fourth.”

The Gestim-Darstellungen texts, which show depictions of the heavenly bodies and their movements, were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls that were discovered in eleven caves of Qumran in I946.! From SOO B.C.E. onwards the nineteen-year cyde was established in Mesopotamia. It evolved into the final form where one full cyde was I9 years and 7 months (23S months). We know Gann was par- ticularly interested in this cyde. The scrolls record that the Moon moves I3° per day.

The Dead Sea Scroll texts state that the beginning of the year was in the sign Taurus. In Jacobus’s book,” in footnote 29 on page S3, is the following statement:

At the vemal (spring) and autumn equinox the sun rises due east and sets due west. Since the time of Ptolemy, the vemal equinox is also known as the First Point of Aries. The plane of the ediptic intersects with the celestial equator at an angle of 23° 27’. The two points of the intersection are the vemal and autumn equinoxes. The equinoxes move westwards on the ediptic (counterdockwise): slipping “backwards” I3° SO’ in IOOO years (1° every 72 years.) More than 2,OOO years before Ptolemy, the vemal equinox was in Taurus (rather than Aries.)

In his book, The Mathematics of the Cosmic Mind: A Study in Math- ematical, Symbolism,’ L. Gordon Plummer wrote, “The number 72 will serve to introduce us to a large family of... numbers, and in time we shall come to recognize them as friends as they appear time and time again. Some of them that we should recognize right away are all-important ones which are related to the cydes of the zodiac, as for instance 2,I6O, as the number of years connected with 1 sign of the zodiac, and 2S,92O as the number associated with the complete Proces- sional cyde.” In Chapter I8 we will examine these cydes more dosely.

Figure 9.4 shows a monthly chart of the IO-Yr U.5. Treasury Notes.

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

The chart contains the transit cyde for Mercury on 72°. What this means is that the first beat is 72° from Aries 0°. It is the same as saying I2° Gemini as each zodiac sign has 3O° of separation. As Mercury transits 72° the cyde beat is marked on the chart. This continues until Mercury crosses 36O° and we reset again at I2° Gemini. The difference between the cyde dosest to the 36O° cusp and the retum to the starting beat will not be 72° because we have to start the cyde from the same location. You will see later we can also chart a true 72° transit, but then each cyde after 36O° will start at a new location to keep the exact interval. As the cyde begins at a slightly different angle each time, each rotation will be slightly different. They are two entirely different types of cydes. Figure 9.4 will always begin at I2° Gemini.

The Gestim-Darstellungen texts contain details about how to read lunar edipse interpretations. The information states that the sign of the month in which the lunar edipse occurs is where one should read the prediction. We will determine it is the period that follows an edipse that is of greater importance, not the exact day. You will see how this made me think about astronomical cydes differently than when 1 began. 1 found through computer modeling that it is important to study market moves fifteen days before and after a cyde event. It is perhaps one of the best changes 1 ever made to the understanding of Gann cydes applied to markets. 1 will demonstrate how to use a computer program to find these trending pattems into and out of a Gann cyde duster when we discuss Gann Analysis. You will discover how Gann instructs us in Tunnel to track an angle of 9O° through the

In the Hathor temple of Dendera there are several “star docks.” They are beautiful in shades of Wedgewood blue (a soft colored blue/gray) and white. The books by 5. Cauville and E. Aubourg (see bibliography at end of chapter) translate these Egyptian inscriptions that pertain to lunar and solar edipses into French.

There is a great wealth of information being obtained by Oxford University’s sponsorship of the translation of the Cuneiform Texts from the Babylonian tablets.> 1 would not use taé/et to describe them; they are more like round pie plates. These tablets are at great risk. The ones found so far number a couple thousand and were discovered in the ruins of Nineveh, Babylon. What we have contains numerous mathematical problems solving astronomical calculations. There are others yet to be uncovered, but they were being destroyed or stolen from Iraq and nearby areas and sold by ISIS. We know of forty tablets pertaining to edipses.

The calculation of months is complex. Scientists define a solar year based on the movements of the Sun but use the movements of the Moon to define a lunar year. The Babylonians had a lunisolar year. Solar years have a different length from lunar years, and the term

“epact” describes this time difference. One epact is II days. Over an interval of 33 years, there will be a lag of one year between solar and lunar calendars. The problem is caused by the fact that the lunar year is approximately 3S4 days which puts it II days behind the solar year of 36S.24 days. So, extra days, and months when you are working with a nineteen-year cyde, must be added to adjust the differential. (The square of I9 is 36I. This is an exceedingly important cyde.) This appended period of time is known as an intercalation. Jacobus writes, “The seven 3O-day lunar months were intercalated at fixed in- tervals of three and two years, [note a Perfect Fifth ratio here of 3:2], thereby creating seven I3-month lunar years of 384 days and twelve I2-month lunar years of 3S4 days in every I9-year cyde. (7 x I3 = 9I; I2 X I2 =I44:9I + I44 = 23S months).” °

Tunnel observation p. S3: “would be fought. Ezekiel IO: I9 and aI:” 2I is inverted: I2-month lunar years in every I9-year cyde. The number I9 is extremely important.

Tiss sgueare and equate IOO8 0/ tp we will cover in geometry inthe Helix section.

There was an additional intercalation of interest within the cyde of I2 x I2 = I44. The number referenced was I8. (Recall that the number of decans marking time in the circular Zodiac of Dendara was 36. (I8 X 2 = 36; 36 X 2 = 72 again.)

The circular Zodiac of Dendara is truly captivating and invites us to learn more about the inscriptions and star docks on the walls and

ceilings of Egypt’s temples and tombs, but how does this connect us to the study of harmonics? How does it apply to Gann?

Early in this section you read, “The Dead Sea Scroll texts state that the beginning of the year was in the sign Taurus.” Gann states his cydes have been anchored and known to the Ancient Egyptians without change through all time. If processional time has moved the start of Aries as much as 3O degrees backwards in a 2OOO-year period, Gann is not using the type of measurement used by Westem astrologers. What he is using will be discovered in a different chapter.

CHAPTER IO

Music Can Be Understood Geometrically

Radio works as the result of sound waves which once set in motion

continue to move and can be picked up by a radio receiving set tuned _ into the same wavelength. You cannot see these sound waves, but you know they work... This is the greatest proof of the unseen forces being the most powerful. You cannot see the air waves or sound waves, but you can hear them and you know they work. You cannot see the Divine force that is in the air, but it is there and all powerful, and it will work mirades for you if you will have faith and put it into action.

—W. D. Gann, The Magic Word, Pp. S9

A. INTRODUCTION TO MUSIC GEOMETRY

Gann gave us his reading list of music theory books, but he must have been given the visuals needed to make the connections elsewhere, because the books he recommended are difficult. Let’s approach this topic, deemed to be the toughest by my students, in the way my students find more palatable.

To begin, it is very helpful to know up front that all the music no- tations like ‘G-A-B-C-E-F?’ are all going to go away. How? You will see we will mathematically cancel these symbols out leaving only numbers, angles, and ratios. We have other options as well. ‘Ex- cellent!’ you may say. ‘Let’s start there.’ However, we cannot. Why

not? Because that way you would not discover that Gann Wheels are harmonic calculators, why interval analysis is about logarithms and square roots, and, most importantly, you would not be able to follow the discussion about the Law of Vibration. So no options here. Sorry. Just dive in.

Everyone has an intuitive sense about sound. If you hear two sounds resonating at the same time, some will be nasty “bad” sounds, and then other combinations will be very pleasing or calming causing a “good” sound. It does not matter if the two tones are equally loud or soft, originating from wind instruments, or keyboard synthesizer, or in Westem versus Tibetan music temperaments. (Temperament is the word we use that names the set of rules required to create a family of tones called a scale.)

What makes a bad sound different from a good sound then? Itis all about the frequency ratio between the two different vibrations. Yes, 1 know. The music major is going to say, “Hey, wait a minute. What about melodic motion, harmonic consistency, the type of scale, or centricity?” Well, melodic motion is a fancy way to say that music that slides from one note up or down in small increments is easier on the ear than big jumps. Our markets don’t care. The math will apply to big jumps and smaller ones.

Harmonic consistency is discussed on page 3OO of Hermann Helm- holtz’s other book, On the Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis

for the Theory of Music (I87S), which is not on Gann’s reading list. It is one dense, nasty discussion, so don’t race out to buy this book. What 1 need to extract for you is simply this: “... they [the frequency ratio between the two different vibrations] relate to the tonic, by the dose relationship of the Fifths.” Figure IO.1 is a cirde diagram where “C” is called the tonic as it is the tone at the top of the cirde and is the first tone that starts a scale. To correlate the word tonic to our field of interest, picture the tonic as the price level that begins or ends a

major price swing. Why does a “Fifth” get our interest, and what is it? The Gann Square of Nine Wheel can calculate Fifths. A Fifth is the ratio 3:2. Itis the interval between two vibrating frequencies created by two tones with exact properties. The Gann Wheel can calculate harmonic intervals. Intervals are important, so expect time devoted to them.

Here is an interesting fact. Dr. Hermann Helmholtz, as described on the inside cover of his book, On the Sensations of Tone as a Phys-

IO. Music Can Be Understood Geometrically

tological Basts for the Theory of Music, was a Professor of Physics in the University of Berlin. He was also a Professor of Physiology in the University of Heidelberg. He was a scientist whose work is still the standard today nearly ISO years later. You are not studying the arts, but a specialized field of mathematics when you want to truly understand our Gann Wheels and harmonic intervals.

This field of study does not have to be crazy difficult for us because music can be defined using visual geometry, but to arrive at the con- dusion that music is visual, we need to go through several steps. The easiest place to start is with Figure IO.1 showing a visual represen- tation of an Equal Temperament Scale.

You will recall we divided the celestial horizon into twelve equal segments of 3O° each. Figure IO.1 starts the same way by dividing a cirde into twelve equal segments of 3O° separation. (36O/I2 = 3O). 1 am always surprised to find, long after the discussion has begun, that the student with no geometry training is lost from the get-go because they don’t know how to measure the 3O°. You will see the angle “3O°” marked below the inner arc of the left drawing in Figure IO.1. If the center was X, the angle CXK equals 3O°. Angle CX (East horizon line) is the full 9O°. The angle is always between two line segments with a common starting point. In geometry any line segment from the center of a cirde to the outer perimeter is called a radius.

In Figure IO.1, one radius moves out to point C while the other is a line segment to K. Now find 3O° up to the inner cirde’s arc. That is where my non-geometry student gets lost. Any point along the line K is 3O° of separation from the same distant point on C.

What does Figure IO.1 have to do with music? Good question. On to the next step:

IO7

Consider a strip of paper in your hands about an inch wide and twelve inches long. Make twelve divisions equally spaced from the left edge marked ‘o’, through 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-IO-II and I2 would be the far-right edge of your paper. Now mark the equally spaced segments numbered at 0-2-4-5-7-9, and II, with the letters C-D-E- F-G-A-B, where ‘C’ is at zero and segment 7 is ‘G’ as each resides on their corresponding number. These are the notes in an Equal Tem- perament Scale. The reason we used 0-2-4-5-7-9, and II to place the letters C-D-E-F-G-A-B is we must follow a set of rules, so our notes have the correct spacing or intervals for this specific music scale called Equal Temperament. Now bend the straight paper line or paper music scale into a cirde. The segment marked zero and I2 will meet at the top connecting C to the start of the next infinite set that always begins at C.

This is one of the ways we will be able to move past all the music letters and retain just number, angles, and ratios that are more appro- priate for our application.

But there are significant problems within the Equal Temperament scale we just created. This scale had to be tweaked—some would say butchered. We will cover that problem in a moment.

Pitches all live on a line. If we start from zero or C on a straight line and travel the length of the line, the right edge would be marked CI because a straight line has to have an extension added in order to create the next sequence of repeating intervals. The interval between the two pitches C and Cr is called an Octave. These two pitches have a ‘Perfect’ interval between them because CI is a frequency exactly double that of C producing a frequency ratio of 2:1. You can create an Octave from two strings where the second string is one half the length of the first. The shorter string will vibrate faster than the longer

string. But it is the ratio between the two vibrating strings that creates the interval.

While pitches live on a straight line, when we create a cirde of pitches, they become a pitch dass. It is no longer necessary to add an extension to a line to carry the sequence forward. We don’t care what octave we are in, and we do not have to use names like C and CI, as long as the relationships between the pitches or intervals keep the same order of separation. Think of it this way: Pitch is like time, but the pitch dass is like the time of day. The dock giving the time of day does not care what day it is. Pitches, however, must track the transition of time, and the day is just as important as the hour.

If the cirde in Figure IO.1 is demonstrating only one type of pitch dass (because the top of the cirde begins with C), then how do we name a new pitch dass? There are two ways to name pitch dasses: by using letters or numbers. The letters for music notation came first

because they were connected to the ancient Egyptian names for the planets and their rate of speed as seen from Earth. (Not the Greeks as 1 incorrectly referenced in my book Fibonacci Analysis.) The fastest rotation, with the highest pitch, was the Moon because the orbital ro- tation around Earth is fastest. But letters are complicated. In music, only the white keys on a piano have their own letter names. The black keys are all named based on their relative position to the white keys. So, a black key just above a white key called C is given the name C# (spoken as “C-sharp”) and we say that C has been augmented by a halftone or semitone. If a black key is just below a white key, we say that the note has been diminished by a halftone or semitone and we use the “flat” symbol, for example Eb (spoken as “E-flat”). We can in- dicate an augmented or diminished tone by more than one halftone by writing multiple sharps and flats. But this is really confusing because a black key can be four steps down from a higher white key, yet still be only one step up from the lower white key next to it. So, musicians

can use two different ways of writing sharps and flats to name the exact same note. That even confuses them!

At first, musicians came up with a combination of letters and numbers. In Figure IO.2, middle C is labeled “C4.” It means it is the start of the fourth octave at C4 called middle-C because it is located in the middle of the piano keyboard. The white note one step below it is B3 as that note is in the previous lower octave that began with C3. That part is easy. But along comes Benjamin Franklin with his instrument that plays Champaign glasses aligned on their sides. You don’t have to move your finger around the top of the glass to make it resonate; the glass rotates under your fingers. Benjamin Franklin’s instrument is called a glass armonica. It is so cool! You should listen to “Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy” from the Nutcracker Suite played in concert on YouTube. It is a quality recording.'

Now that we have music from wine glasses and not on a keyboard,

how does someone know what notes to play? Hermann Helmholtz enters our discussion again as the music notations remained a problem. He solves the problem one way by using letters in a system called “The Helmholtz Pitch Notation System.”

The chart in Figure IO.3 shows four common pitch and octave numbering systems. Row 1 shows MIDI numbering. The second row is Octave Numbering (Japanese, Yamaha, Encore). The third row is Octave Numbering (scientific, MusicXML, and others). Row 4 is the Helmholtz Pitch Numbering System. Row 4 looks a lot like the Elliott Wave Principle’s method to define various degrees. And we know that is not going to be the best way, because Elliott Wave an-

alysts have a bad habit of grabbing the degree that is easiest to type. Caps, lowercase, subscripts, and exponential positioning are a real pain to type. So, fast-forward to row 1.

In Figure IO.3, the MIDI notation is in row 1. It is how musicians created a standard to name frequencies that indude tones that are not on a piano keyboard. MIDI is short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It was introduced in I983. MIDI does not play any sounds. One would need a MIDI software synthesizer to hear the MIDI notes. But this means we do have ways that allow us to escape the use of letters, sharps, and flats when referencing a specific tone or frequency. MIDI works well for a single frequency, but what we are really in- terested in is the interval between two frequencies. If our market is at price x, we want to know where the next significant price will be relative to the first.

2 The white key marked ‘1’ can be named a on couple ways. We now know it is middle C, . or C4, or just C if we do not care about the

I3 precise octave. Then in I983 it was given the

Ww MIDI number, or pitch number 6O. We will

stay with a keyboard and not worry about frequencies that may fall between the keyboard notes.

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

From the white key 1 we can move up one key to the black key marked 2. This small step is called a semitone or halftone. If we continue and move to the next key, it is a white key called D and marked 3. We have travelled two semitones or two halftones. Two halftones equal a whole tone. It is the prescribed combination of whole tones and halftones that creates the rules for a specific scale of pitches.

Slide rulers were in vogue until hand calculators came on the scene, but they are still used today because they are faster than punching numbers into a computer. 1 have my old one on my desk. That is likely the inspiration for this explanation. Consider the cirde we used in Figure IO.1, Fundamentals of an Equal Temperament Scale. The letters C-D-E-F-G-A-B were not placed on every 3O° division. The reason for this was that the music pitch dass was illustrating a major scale and the intervals between pitches must follow specific rules about their spacing. An interval is just a musical distance.

In Figure IO.4 the dark rectangle slides over a fixed scale of named white and black keys in light gray. The slider has been moved so that the window shows the note C on the start on the left side. The slider shows that 7 is the note B. The number 7 just means the seventh note in the series. The formula for this type of scale is a fixed series of tones. “W-W-h-W-W-W” where “W” is a whole tone and “h” is the semitone or halftone. The scale does not end on B. If we want to start anew octave, another semitone is added before CI to start anew higher octave. In the cirde diagram Figure IO.1, a semitone is 3O°. The keys E and F are next to one another because they are semitone intervals. If you look dosely at B you will see we skip a semitone to retum to C. The slide ruler visually makes this next step much easier.

You can move the slider anywhere along the scale and find the pitches that fit the interval rules in Equal Temperament to create a

major scale with intervals “W-W-h-W-W-W.” IfI moved the slider over so the start at ‘1’ aligns with the note F, the scale of whole and halftones would align with F-G-A- B}-C-D-E. If we drew a cirde with the top marked F, we just created a new pitch dass because F is now on the top at 0/36O°. If we had an outside ring with the rules marked “W-h-W-W-W-h” we could just slide the outer ring to the right and find the new sequence of intervals, provided we marked all the tones on the edge.

Ah, you can see this one coming a country mile away: we have such a slide ruler—it is called a Gann Wheel and the overlays with subdivisions such as 3O°, 4S°, I2O° will give us the interval readings we will need. However, there is much more to learn before you know the correct Wheel and angles to use for any given market. The Square

of Nine cannot be used as a generic slide ruler thinking one tool fits all. The Hexagon Wheel will be just as important.

C. MATHEMATICS: THE PERFECT FOURTH AND PERFECT FIFTH

Where to begin? A good place is the story of how all of us, especially Pythagoras, leamed about the Perfect Fifth and Perfect Fourth ratios. It has been passed on through the ages of mankind on the wall reliefs and cartouches of ancient Egyptian temples and tombs. Musical in- struments depicted on ceilings and walls often show the same finger placements on specific strings that reveal three “perfect” ratios. The hand positions of people in the Egyptian drawings are important. An upwards facing hand is like the conductor. The people sitting before

the conductor display different finger positions that scholars describe as musical intervals. Various arm positions in a series of people in a row can show rhythm. When the thumb and fifth finger are outward and the second, third and fourth fingers are dosed, this is a way to indicate a specific interval between tones.

Consider the image in Figure IO.5: The Egyptian god Thoth: The god of Wisdom. Thoth is pointing to three cubes with his right hand. (The cubes are inkwells as he is also the god of Writing.) The pen in his right hand is not pointing to the middle of a cube in preparation to write; he is dearly marking a division between the three cubes creating the ratio 3:2, called a Perfect Fifth.

Numerous artifacts of the god Thoth were safe for 5,OOO years. Then one senseless night in August of 2OI3 Egyptian teenage looters ransacked the archaeological museum in the town of Mallawi, located about I9O miles south of Cairo. Salima Ikram, Professor of Egyp- tology at the American University in Cairo, said the looting left enormous gaps in our understanding of ancient Egyptian religious rites because the looted material had not been studied.

The intervals of a Perfect Fifth (3:2), Perfect Fourth (4:3), and Octave (2:1) are described in Curt Sachs book, History of Musical Instruments.” Examining in the temples and tomb walls of ancient Egypt he found that, out of I7 harpists depicted with sufficient darity to examine, seven harpists are striking a Perfect Fourth interval, and five are playing a Perfect Fifth interval. He also found five more striking the ratio 2:1 or the Octave. Musicians will find it of interest that two harps in Ramses III’s tomb have I3 strings. If the longest string represents D, the remaining I2 would complete all the tones,

semi-, and quartertones of the diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic scales within the octave.

The ratios themselves describe how to divide the length of a musical string to create a harmonic sound between the two vibrating string lengths.

To understand why a ratio is called a Perfect Fifth from a more common interval called a fifth, we need to make a mathematical comparison.

Our study begins with the scale familiar to you when the dassics like Mozart and Beethoven are played ona piano. Orchestras tune their in- struments using an Equal Temperament Scale. The note middle C has a frequency that vibrates at 26I cydes per second, or 26I Hz (Hertz). We are interested in the intervals called the fifth and fourth, but how do we calculate the interval of a fifth, or ratio 3:2 up from 26I Hz? To multiply a number by a fraction we multiply by the numerator,

Octave 2:1 Perfect Sth 3:2 Perfect 4th 4:3

the top number, and then divide by the bottom number. Therefore (26I x 3)/2 equals 392 Hz; that would give us the two frequencies that are separated by the interval called a fifth. But it is not perfectly in tune. We will come back to this problem.

To divide a number by a fraction we multiply by the denominator (bottom number) and then divide by the numerator (top number). To find the interval called a fourth moving down from 392 Hz, would be 392 x 4/3 = (393 x 3)/ 4 or 294 Hz. That seems easy enough. But why am 1 leaving out the word perfect when describing these two intervals?

Music scales are all created from a prime base number raised to an exponential. The Equal Temperament Scale is derived from Base-2. But the only way to obtain the perfect or exact ratio 3:2 is from a scale derived from Base-3 called the Pythagorean Scale. Table IO.8T il- lustrates the problem. In Figure IO.I9 you will see the Pythagorean Scale applied as an overlay on the Square of Nine Wheel. This ref- erence to how scales are created from Prime numbers is important for understanding scale construction fully and it will be applied later in our market analysis.

The Equal Temperament Scale is a man-made series of intervals. When the reed was invented for the wind instruments this extended their range dramatically causing a problem for orchestras when the octave ranges they could play were extended. When an orchestra played up seven octaves using the Pythagorean Scale, they came back down the scale on a different note. The problem was in the scale itself as there is a very small interval called the Pythagorean comma that is added at the end of the scale going up but added to the bottom when the scale descends. Euler, a Swiss mathematician, proposed the idea we need to add thirds to the Pythagorean scale to help smooth out the problem (called Just Intonation). That did not really work, but

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

we will find that the thirds can be useful for our purposes. Then Euler tried again, and the Equal Temperament Scale was devised to fix the problem once and for all. The instruments all land on the same note now, musicians are happy, but to fix the problem they had to math- ematically butcher the perfect harmonic ratios of the Pythagorean scale. This means the music scale we are most familiar with is a series of notes that are all slightly out-of-tune until they arrive at the octave interval again.

Figure IO.8T gives the ideal theoretical and actual ratios of the in- tervals in the Equal Temperament Scale. The “ET”’ or Equal Tem- perament error column is the one of interest to us. Only the octave, or 2:1 ratio, remains in tune. All the other intervals are either a little flat or sharp, meaning some undershoot or some overshoot their ideal theoretical ratio that would bring them into a perfect ratio.

All scales begin from a prime factor raised to an exponential. Equal Temperament is a Base-2 scale constructed from 27, 27I, n°, 2', 27, and so forth.

The Pythagorean Scale is created using Base-3 raised to an expo- nential that increases by 1 or decreases by -1 from n°. Any number raised to an exponential of zero will equal 1.

Each individual prime-factor notation can represent the pitch dass we could put on the top of the cirde, as we did for the Equal Tem- perament pitch dasses in Figure IO.1.

The Pythagorean Diatonic (minor) scale is the Greek system, which is also called the natural scale. When we create a table, whose x-axis represents powers of 3, we can display the results in the following way. The table below gives the letter names and semitone values as well.

But the correct order of prime-factors above is not the order of pitches we would hear from a lower to higher pitched sound. The x-axis of prime-factor notations must be rearranged to fit within an octave that begins at ‘A’ and ends at ‘AI’. The best part is that all this sorting is done within the Gann Square of Nine Wheel, and we do not have to worry about it. The sorting into the correct order produces the following pitches from a lower to higher tone called the standard Pythagorean diatonic “natural minor” scale.

The Pythagorean Scale uses the three ratios: 1.333, 1.5, and the octave at 2.0. The theoretical ratio 1.3333 is exact, allowing us to use the term the Perfect Fourth. Same for the ratio 1.5; it is exact in the Pythagorean Scale and hence it is called the Perfect Fifth.

In Figure IO.8T, on the bottom right are the intervals in cents; we will use these as percentages in our market analysis in the next section called “The Pythagorean Scale Applied.”

Each sequential outer row increases the number of flats and sharps. The flats all fall on one side of the pyramid and the sharps all fall on the opposite side. This can only be accomplished when a scale is con- structed from Base-3. If you visit 32ndJewel.com (which will be the primary book site address for readers), you can see Figure IO.9 as a

3-D color animation. The animation will transform from the flat 2-di- mensional layout into a 3-dimensional pyramid. It will then transform a third time into a ball that drops causing ripples as if dropped into water. The reason for the last transformation is that the Pythagorean intervals can be used as concentric cirdes radiating outwards from a primary market price low or high. The intervals between the con- centric cirdes define levels of support or resistance. We will look at this application shortly in this chapter.

II8 D. MATHEMATICS OF CENTS AND INTERVALS Tunnel observations:

“The money meant nothing to him. He would gladly give every cent of it to have Marie...” Tunnel Thru The Air, p. I62OOO: “to per cent of his profits...” (p.I98.) The word percent, pea “per cent,” is used only three times in dose proximity in the entire book. _ Three times is how the Bible puts emphasis into a statement. Gann _ follows this way to mark someriiing as extremely ease Does

of measurement called the cent @?

Before we start applying the Pythagorean intervals, we need to rec- ognize that we might be heading toward a problem. We understand that the separation between two frequencies is an interval. How do we study two entirely different scales where one is created from Base-2, Equal Temperament, and the other is Base-3, Pythagorean? What if we wanted to compare intervals within a prime-factored system like Base-5, Base-7, or even Base-II? Is there even such a thing? How would we work with them?

Any prime numbered system can mathematically be created. We call them a system because they are limited to a specified prime factor. A 3-limit system is limited to Base-3. An II-limit system would be Base-II. We need a way to easily compare the intervals in these different systems. The solution to measure intervals is to use a unit called cents (¢).

In the nineteenth century A. J. Ellis (I8I4-I89O) introduced the unit “cent” for measuring interval size. The word cent comes from

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

the Latin centum meaning IOO. Cents were defined for the Equal Temperament Scale by dividing the octave into twelve equal parts giving each semitone a value of IOO cents. Therefore, the full octave would equal I2OO cents.

Much of Gann analysis is logarithmic and square roots. 1 never use semi-log chart displays where the y-axis is in logarithms and the x-axis remains an arithmetic scale. Why? 1 do not want logs of logs as it distorts the Time analysis as stated by J. L. Jensen:

a “.,. and applies them to a system which is a coupling of time and price. Itis a simple charting of market prices. It is so simple any change or revision in the basic premises involved destroys its effectiveness. t will _

not work properly with logarithmic scales, and the dependence on time _ brooks no shortcuts or distortion in the arithmetic scale.” _ —Luther J. Jensen, Aséro-Cyeles and Speculative Markets (I93S)p. vl

- Note that W. D. Gann trained Mr. Jensen.

You can convert any frequency ratio interval to its size in cents using the following formula:

Cents = I2OO x log (fI/f2) / log2. The frequency ratio is J2/fr.

The formula can also be written using a log IO function:

¢ = I2OO X 3.322O384O3 log,, (f2 / fi)

1/log 2 = 1/0.3OIO2999S = 3.322O384O3. The 3.322O384O3 is a con- version factor that converts base 2 logarithms to base IO logarithms.

For the Equal Temperament Scale 1 Cent = 2 6/9 =

1.OOO§77789 SO6S S48S9296792S7S7932

One cent is therefore the number, that when multiplied by itself I2OO times, will equal 2 or the full octave.

---

IO. Music Can Be Understood Geometrically

We can also confirm that the cent is an interval which is calculated from an interval frequency ratio as follows: [interval of the interval frequency ratio / interval (2)]) x I2OO = cents value of the interval. An interval of a halftone is equivalent to: 2(1/I2) = 1.OS9463O943S929S264S6I82S2949463. That is: [interval (2(1/I2)) / interval (2)]xI2OO cent = IOO cent.

Why do we need all of this math? Most people in our industry only write about Equal Temperament Intonation in their understanding of Gann analysis, thus ignoring the Pythagorean.

The problem of interval comparisons between different types of scales is one of the reasons why Gann sent us off to read Hermann Helmholtz. But a Base-2 environment is one thing, how do we work within Base-3?

The toughest puzzle we can encounter in the Pythagorean Scale is the interval of the Pythagorean comma, that pesky small interval that messed up all those orchestras of the past.

The Pythagorean comma is the frequency ratio (3/2)? / 27 = 3 / 2 = S3I44I / S24288 = 1.OI364326477OSO78I2S. The result is converted to 23.46OOIO384649OI3 cents. (The conversion formula follows shortly.) Twelve perfect fifths (3/2) should equal 8423.46 cents; however, the math reveals only 84OO cents. That’s why the Py- thagorean Scale would cause instruments to land on a different note if they ascended seven octaves and then descended. They ended sharp, meaning higher than expected and on a wrong note.

Why do we care? Do we have to deal with calculations like this often? No, because we will be working with the ratios within one scale at any given time. But this background is needed because our industry is missing an important point. Those of us who know have not been writing much about it. The Gann Wheel is not 2-dimensional, it is

II9

a helix. The people who just subdivide by eighths cannot work with a Pythagorean helix with a growth cyde known as a conical-helix, the natural cyde of growth and decay or market expansion and con- traction. We will look at this further when we study non-Eudidean geometry. To know why we use the angles we do from the different wheels requires a study of music harmonic ratios first. Then we can go on to three dimensions and even a fourth dimension.

How many cents are there in a Hertz?

That is a trick question. Hertz is measuring the cydes per second of a specific frequency and does not measure an interval. The unit cent is a logarithmic unit that can only measure an interval and that is a dimensionless frequency ratio. The truth is we only care about the ratios. It is the ratio between significant market highs and lows we seek.

When we map roo cents ona cirde it equals 3O° in the Equal Tem- perament Scale. Do not pass over that reference too quickly. 1 am making a statement that refers to a frequency ratio, converted to cents; then cents are used as degrees or angles. This is the Gann concept that will grow as we add what we need from geometry and astronomical measurements. All these different disciplines of study will have con- version methods to pass easily from one discipline to the other and back again as needed.

E. ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION OF HARMONIC RATIOS

How did 1 create the subdivisions in Figure IO.IO of the 5&PsSOO monthly data? There should also be a question about the ratio 9:8 as we have not discussed it.

they relate to one another in units of cents. Like the steps de- scribed to create a scale for Equal Temperament, the Pythagorean Diatonic Minor Scale (the natural scale) follows a set of rules. The rules define the order and the number of whole tones to halftones.

Figure IO.IO displays the cents between intervals as a per- centage so that 1 could fool my software to plot the intervals needed. The exact placement in cents for a Pythagorean scale is: 0, 2O3.9, 4O7.8, 498.0, 7O2.0, 9OS.9, IIO9.8, and I2OO. Therefore Figure IO.IO shows the price for the 5&PSOO with the percentage beside it. The percentages used were 0, 2O.4%, 4O.8%, 49.8%, 7O.2%, 9O.6%, IIO.9%, and I2O%. You may need to tum off IOO% as we would not use it when mapping a harmonic scale. 1 save this template as “Pythagorean” to use as needed. 1 have used this for years.

A whole tone has the ratio of 9:8. The order 9:8, 9:8, 2S6/243, 9:8, etc. never changes. The Pythagorean comma S3I,44I / S24,288 is being ignored. Figure IO.IO shows the 5&PSOO into the 2OO2 market price low. When the ratios from the I987 crash low are compared to the market high, the Perfect Fifth and Perfect Fourth ratios of 3:2 and 4:3 are exactly marking critical swings within the price range. The full price range is itself an octave.

We have now met our Waterloo. The problem for most people in my experience has been working with harmonic fractions. People hit a brick wall when they really try to think about the 5&PsOO chart in Figure IO.IO. How do you answer this question: “How can 4:3 and 3:2 equal a full octave or the 2:1 ratio?” Itis very difficult because people assume the following: to add the two ratios, find the common denominator and all is good to go.

---

When we add two musical intervals together we must mudtply the _ _ corresponding ratios. Similarly, when we subtract one interval from

another we must divide one ratio by the other: a fifth (:2) minus a _ fourth (4:3) is a whole tone or 3:2 divided by 4:3 equals 9:8.

How do 1 answer the question, How many times will one interval go into another? How many times, for instance, does a Perfect Fifth (3:2) go into an octave (2:1)? Remember, we are not asking our- selves how many times do we add 3:2 to itself to get 2:1, but how many times do you multiply 3:2 by itself to get 2:1.

In terms of a length of string, there is an easier way to ask this question: How many times can 1 keep taking two thirds of a string before 1 have halved the length of the string? The answer lies between 1 and 2: 2/3 of a string is longer than half of the string, but 4/9 of the string (the result of taking 2/3, and then 2/3 again) is shorter than half of the string. In terms of ratios this means 3:2 is less than 2:1, but (3:2)? = 9:4 which is greater than 2:1. So, somewhere in between there must be a power of 3:2 which is exactly equal to 2:1.

One way is to use vector math—this will not be our final method to solve the problem, so don’t panic just yet. It goes like this:

How do you add a major third to a minor third? A major third is 5/4 and a minor third interval is the ratio 6/5.

(major third = 5/4 = 5") x (minor third = 6/5 = 3IS")

Using vector addition:

[3°5"] + [3'5'] = 3IS° that equals 3! which equals = 3/2, a Perfect Fifth. Okay, so there has to be a better way, as 1 am not going to do this again and 1 know you would not want to either.

Take this problem as an Equal Temperament question about how

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

to calculate the size of a semitone (halftone) that divides the octave into twelve equal parts. We can calculate the twelfth root of 2.

V2 = 1.OS9463O943S93

The following table shows that we can use this number to calculate the frequency of each semitone:

To calculate the twelfth root of 2 will get you very dose, but this method is not exact either. The problem can be solved by applied log- arithms to get an exact value for x from the equation (3:2)* = (2:1).

The point is this: it is not that easy to do. How do we get around this? Just use a Gann Wheel. 1 hope you are beginning to see that Gann’s Wheels are truly amazing calculators.

Knowing the Greek names of the Pythagorean intervals is useful so that you can recognize the numeric ratios themselves that may not be displayed if you do any research in this field. Here are the Greek names for the ratios an octave, a fifth, and a fourth. The table also demonstrates some interval mathematics you’ll need to know.

Some people want more guidance to beef up their math skills. 1 send them off to visit KhanAcademy.org, an awesome free site that covers numerous fields of study. 1 have spent many hours listening to these dear and precise lectures. But it is not just math, geometry, algebra, calculus skills, and such; you will find a host of topics.

Do you have children? 1’m suggesting you take a virtual holiday. Figure IO.I2 is a portion of a famous painting by Raphael called the School of Athens. KhanAcademy can walk you to Raphael’s painting and put you in the room once reserved for the Pope’s library in the Vatican. Sorry, you even have the noise of a large touring group as their enthusiasm bounces through the marble room. The painting shows Pythagoras explaining the musical ratios to a pupil. Notice the tablet shows the words diatesseron, diapente, and diapason. The Roman numerals for 4, 6, 8, 9, I2, and I6 create these ratios. The Greek word for a wholetone, enoraoan (epogdoon), is at the top. Under the tablet is a triangular number ro called the sacred tetractys.?

In various works of art we see Pythagoras hitting bells, plucking strings of different lengths and tapping glasses filled with different amounts of water all marked with the numbers 4, 6, 8, 9, I2, and I6. The 8 and I6 form the octave called diapason. Pythagoras is seen holding pipes I2 and 9, giving the ratio 4:3, the Perfect Fourth or diatesseron. In Theorica Musica, Philolaos holds 6 and 4 giving the ratio 3:2 or the Perfect Fifth, the diapente ratio. Knowing this helps us to understand Gann’s reference to the Bible: “His brother’s name

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe” (Genesis 4:2I, English Standard Version).*

F. LATTICE DIAGRAMS: A FIRST STEP TO UNDER- STANDING THE LAW OF VIBRATION

We can now begin to take our first steps toward a study of the Law of Vibration. This discussion that introduces lattice diagrams for you will create the framework. Then we can add the additional layers in subsequent chapters.

We began with one string divided into lengths that visually demon- strated the proportions needed to define the ratios of the Pythagorean Scale (see Fig. IO.8 repeated below).

Perfect 4th

4. Note that 1 have given the quote in the English Standard Version, whereas Gann uses the King James Bible. In the King James version, the quote reads as follows: “And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ.” The more modem translation may make Gann’s Pythagorean references more dear; thus when you search Gann’s quotes in the Bible, it may help to use a cross-translation website, such as Bible Hub. 1 have a Freemason Bible, and it is a modified King James Version. This raised a few questions for me. The Freemason Bible has a large index section of grouped verses by topic.

If our string length were 36O mm long, the correct subdivisions of

IO. Music Can Be Understood Geometrically I2S

the string would be the following:

Note | Interval Ratio | String length

C Octave 2:1 I8O/36O I8O isa Gann Wheel Angle

A sixth major | 5:3 2I6/36O 2I6 is the Perfect Fifth from I2O°

G fifth 3:2 24O/36O 24O isa Gann Wheel Angle

F fourth 43 27O/36O 27O is a Gann Wheel Angle

E third major | 5:4 288/36O I44 is a Gann Wheel Angle x 2

Cc first/ [il 36O/36O 36O is the com-

keynote pletion of the

rotation.

We can see most of the string lengths are the same numbers we use as angles of interest in a Gann Square of Nine Wheel. This is the first time we see geometric proportions converted to angles. This will become very important in later discussions. Now consider this: If we begin to create a lattice matrix using these ratios, we begin to see another pattem emerge that we recognize to be a hexagon. The 5:4 ratio is the major third ratio. When the thirds were added to the Pythagorean scale it was called Just Intonation. The thirds are cool, we like them as markets resonate at these intervals, especially

Treasury bonds.

Interesting that in this small segment of the lattice we need a third to develop the second or top row.

5/3 — 5/4 / \/ X

4/3 —1/1 —3/2

As the lattice pattem of music ratios are extended a larger net of relationships forms.

This diagram is more useful than a cirde because a cirde cannot tell the whole story. A series can be readily identified with another series. In this example select the Perfect Fifth at 3:2 as a beginning. The ratios 6:5 and 9:5 will have a relationship to one another and the 3:2 ratio as they form a triad in the lattice diagram. The diagonal ratios such as 3:2, §:4, and 2S:24 are on the same vector showing they will have a connection. A vector from 3:2, IS:8 onwards is a vector on a different

---

diagonal and will also have a relationship to one another. The ratio 3:2 could be viewed as a starting price pivot and the harmonic ratios that extend from the start are projected price targets within a market.

However, the vector moving on a diagonal from 5:3 and a diagonal from 6:5 will never have a connection though they are each important number sets within the whole. We can view vector series that are parallel to one another as well. The Law of Vibration is contained within this grid, but it is just a small portion of the first layer of the net that will become multidimensional as our understanding grows. Yoda was right, everything has a force and all things are connected. The Law of Vibration is called the Law of One by some Orders other than Freemasons. The Egyptians believed that The Law of One was more than vibratory sound complexes. This you will see to be correct as we add geometry and astronomy to our discussion.

A lattice diagram is a very cool way to visually diagram intervals. A lattice limited to just Base-3 intervals is called a limit-3 system. A Hexagonal Lattice or 5-limit Triangular Lattice can be defined around the triads:

MAJOR MINOR E A E /\ \ / / \ \ / / \ \/ Cc G Cc

A step to the right is a fifth (1.SOO). Up-right is a major third (1.2SOO), and down-right is a minor third (1.2OO). This lattice is oc- tave-equivalent, meaning it repeats with every octave. The left side and right side of lattice diagrams are connected. You will learn in our geometry discussion that when you exit the right side and find

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

yourself on the left-side of the diagram, then you have just expe- rienced hyper-space of non-Eudid geometry or the math of cones, just like the old Asteroid or Pac-Man video games. If you explore the concept further you will discover that a lattice diagram evolves into a hyperbolic curve that would connect price, time, volume, and space. 1 do not apply fourth-dimension concepts to the markets, but it doesn’t mean that in the future someone else couldn’t find a way to push this outer edge of the envelope.

When we extend the triangular lattice diagram, the series will look like this:

/\ 7 / \/ G-------D--

\ SN

\/ A-------E--------B /\

IV IX IN IN INT IV\ETN ITN ENING / \L NI \/

Gb -------D b -----Ab -----Eb -----Bb =-----F

Each point on the lattice is connected to 6 others, so 1 prefer to call it a hexagonal lattice. However, in music theory it is usually called a triangular lattice.

Just a note for musicians, triangles are used rather than squares so

IO. Music Can Be Understood Geometrically

that a minor third appears as a more consonant interval than a major seventh. Consonance is generally related to distance on a harmonic lattice. When you bring multiple octaves into it, a three-dimensional cubic lattice is more appropriate.

For the non-musician, here is the important take away: these are three-dimensional geometric models. Music is geometry. A limit-5 model connects triangles that define a hexagonal model. But there are such things as 7-Limit Tetrahedral Lattices. The first person to create a tetrahedral lattice was Erv Wilson. His original hand-drawn lattices can be found at the President Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.

The book by Harry Partch, Genesis of a Music: An Account of a Creative Work, Its Roots, and its Fulfillments, Second Edition, is the source for Paul Erlich’s work on Prime-Limits. To repeat myself for emphasis: any pitch system where all the ratios are integers containing no prime factors higher than prime number ‘n’ is said to be an ‘n-limit’ system. Pythagorean tuning would be a ‘3-limit’ system because all the intervals are Base-3. If you constructed a 2-dimensional infinite coordinate set of a 3-limit system, it would look something like the arrangement below.

However, Paul Erlich took the two-dimensional flat plane and ex-

pressed in an email that harmonic intervals are vectors.> This made the connection for me to see how the lattice diagram can be used within a financial chart application.

Using the concept of vectors opens the door to other possibilities. As an example, it is insufficient to de- scribe the triangle of a 5-Limit (Base-5) system as a two-dimensional plane because it becomes a tetra- / a\, hedron and is drawn in this manner: Cun--n- ee

The 7-Limit lattice is also a three-dimensional system based on whole-number ratios that involve 5 factors of seven. Therefore, they can be written on a lattice with numbers as:

The number 7 projects out on the z-axis. Here is 1 -------- 3 what happens when multiple points are connected. A three-dimensional pattem of interconnecting planes begins to form on an x, y, and z-axis.

All the Sacred Geometry pattems we are more familiar with use single-unit building blocks to create these three-dimensional harmonic geometric models. But Sacred Geometry and the Platonic Solids have a unique property we will decode in the geometry discussion.

Please visit http://www.tonalsoft.com/enc/1/lattice.aspx, where you can see how Joe Monzo builds a single model using 3-limit, 5-limit, 7-limit, and II-limit systems. His shading makes the multiple planes easy to see. The model grows proportionally larger on each x-, y-, and z-axis plane as higher prime-limit systems are added.

Paul Erlich has created an II-Limit tonality diamond in emails with Joe Monzo. The image above 1 had to type. It is not a drawing. 1 used the music notation because it takes less space to label each in- tersection. You should see the models these guys are doing in emails by typing. Incredible! However, what they never seem to discuss is the fact their II-Limit Lattice, when the exterior points of the planes are connected, will form an icosahedron. Figure IO.I3 on the bottom left comer is my drawing of an icosahedron without all the music letter notations and ratios. Not only is this one of the Platonic solids,

---

Figure IO.I3 shows why Gann analysis seems to step on Fibonacci so often. For further illustrations, google “Pacioli’s construction of

the icosahedron.”

Between the two names Paul Erlich and Joe Monzo, you likely have the best in the business for complex geometric models from harmonic r principles. The top professor teaching advanced harmonic matrix lattices and geometry in music is at Princeton University. His name

is Professor Dmitri Tymoczko.

The concept of lattice diagrams originates from the Swiss mathema- tician 1 have named previously, Leonard Euler. The search words you need to explore this field further are Lambdoma and Duodenarium. Rei-

mann’s “ Tonnetz diagrams” were used to demon- strate microtonal pitch relationships.

The takeaway from all this work is to show you that music ratios define three-dimensional space. That is very cool indeed. The financial industry is only on the cusp of developing three-dimen- sional modeling. Knowing markets resonant to the Base-3 Pythagorean Scale or limit-3 system is a good place to develop these concepts further.

If you are researching Perfect Fifths in Py- thagorean tuning from 37” to 3'2, normalized to one reference octave and ordered by the exponent of prime factor 3, this list will be a quick reference of these ratios for you followed by their equivalent cents:

G. THE PYTHAGOREAN SCALE APPLIED

1 know you are more than ready to see how we are going to apply the Pythagorean Scale intervals to the markets. Let me show you a couple of ways: first, concentric targets of support and resistance, and then an application on the diagonal axis.

Figure IO.I4 is a Crude Oil (Spot) bar chart in a monthly time

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

horizon. Recognize a cirde is just a type of ellipse as we will cover in Chapter I3. Figure IO.I4 is the Pythagorean Scale applied from a major down beat in this market. The intervals between each concentric ring are the cent intervals of the Pythagorean Scale from Figure IO.II or Table IO.8T: 2O.4, 4O.8, 49.8, 7O.2, 9O.6, IIO.9, and I2O.0.

To set the range between the start and the outer octave ring at I2O, set the rings based on a price area of resistance behind the selected starting price. This is underlined as this is never allowed when de- veloping Fibonacci Confluence zones. 1 have had to browbeat many students to stop looking at data that has been retraced rather than using the strong bars within current data or data that would have never been stopped out. Now, in this one application 1 am putting the emphasis on the older data because we are setting up the harmonic ratios.

Use the data to the left of center and then let the rings fall as they may on the right-hand side of the chart from your selected pivot start. In Figure IO.I4, 1 cannot ever ignore time analysis. Gann’s Time Factors are astronomical events. When we have a confluence of cydes that duster together on the vertical axis, and price uses a Pythagorean ring as resistance, we have something we want to pay high attention to as a possible reversal could develop. In this chart 1 am displaying cydes that primarily define price highs.

The Oil market forms a new price high and drops into 2OIS. The rebound into 2OI6 allows me to take the exact same set of rings (copy/ paste) without changing their scale or proportion using the new price low extreme to the right of the prior center selected.

The first set of concentric cirdes in Figure IO.IS is made less intense by using a transparency feature. They have also been replaced with dashes. The new Pythagorean series in Figure IO.IS is shown as the solid lines of concentric cirdes. They are exact in every way to the

first set, but now the second series begins from the new price low. The black arrows will help you see how the new set of rings are respected in the prior trend to the left.

The Pythagorean Scale can also be used on the diagonal axis.

Figure IO.I6 is the 5&PSOO in a 2-week bar chart. The tool 1 use is a conventional Fibonacci Channel tool where 1 again replace all the vendor’s Fibonacci ratios, 38.2, SO.0, 6I.8 with our Pythagorean in- tervals. Just keep this in mind that we are using ratios not arithmetic values. Use the same set of percentages we used in a prior example: 0, 2O.4, 4O.8, 49.8, 7O.2, 9O.6, IIO.9, and I2O.0.

This charting tool starts from a user defined starting price and then you drag your cursor to set the channel width. The Pythagorean in- tervals of ratios are all created as relative to the original channel. So, choose your first channel wisely. The two top diagonal lines in Figure IO.I6 is the channel range 1 selected. Why? To really be proficient on the why you need to read Fibonacci Analysis, which explains why [use the pivots 1 do in my Fibonacci work. Those same concepts are critical here. The fast-track summary is not to use key reversals; start from a bar that defines a strong move wherever possible. Gaps are also geometric mile markers. The first line is the first retracement off the market high. The second level of the channel was selected because it is an internal double top into a healthy bounce, and a key reversal spike down behind it lets me set the correct angle of ascent of the channel. The other diagonals are the Pythagorean ratio intervals as they relate to the selected channel width.

Figure IO.I7 is a copy of the first set of ratios. 1 must not change the range proportions of the first, nor the width of the original channel. So, using a copy/paste series of steps from the first channel to a new starting pivot is best. To select the second starting price, you

should know my method of creating Fibonacci confluence zones. 1 know strong bars and gaps are the geometric milestones within any market swing we want to select. Strong down bars or gaps in this chart would be the resonating markers that will create future swings. This knowledge will bias my price selection now. The black upward arrow on the left shows the start of the copied Pythagorean Scale. The magnified window on the left shows that the channel starts from a bar that leads to a strong move down. That is what you want to look for, and it will never be from a price high. Most people only see the starts and ends of swings and never consider internal price action. If this describes you, you must change to increase your probability of being precise. The second set of Pythagorean diagonals creates con- fluence target zones of support and resistance. This method does a nice job for several years forward. The levels drawn on the second series have been extended into a second rotation, or octave. 1 would not recommend going further out than a second rotation. The Py- thagorean values are in the extended window on the left of the screen.

H. CIRCLE OF FIFTHS AND THE GANN SQUARE OF NINE WHEEL

With much of the music theory behind us, we can focus on why the Pythagorean Scale is an integral part of our study of Gann’s methods. Figure IO.I8 is a Cirde of Perfect Fifths. The series of correct string length ratios creates the spiral. When you search the Intemet, you will find many “Cirde of Fifth” diagrams, and most have music notation with instruction how to transpose from one key to another using the Cirde of Fifths diagram. What is of value to us is extending these spiral intersections to the outer wheel to define the angles. We do not

need the music notation, and we should at this point accept that we are working from square roots and logs. In fact, we can now leave the musicians to head off in a different direction than we will go. The music theorists have given us all we need.

Someone is going to email me that there is an error in Figure IO.I8. They will calculate an absolute angle in degrees from the I2O or 24O° from 36O and question why the exact number of degrees is not used in the intervals of other pairings. Once again we face the most common error made. Please do not forget, you are not asking how many times does 3:2 fit into 36O. The math, if you skipped that section, is in Addition and Subtraction of Harmonic Ratios. It was important. The diagram is correct in Figure IO.I8; it is just not the math you are expecting for fractions. Do not assume Arithmetic Ratios and Harmonic Ratios are handled similarly. The brief reference here to Gann’s Square of Nine Wheel and other Wheels will be discussed fully in Chapter 29.

Gann applied what he was taught by the Freemasons. The Py- thagorean Scale is sacred to them. Most Gann Analysts do not use the I44 and 2I6 angles, but they are certainly well-known to the grain traders. The I44 and 2I6 angles are on the Gann Wheel that was developed by Nikki Jones. Only a few understood why the Gann Wheel induded these intervals and their importance within the Cirde of Fifths.

Figure IO.I8 is drawn as a counterdockwise spiral giving the correct angles for a descending market. Figure IO.I9 is a Gann Square of 9 with an overlay of Pythagorean angles. The square configuration remains the same though we will study the use of different overlays.

As an introduction, another reason Figure IO.I8 is important is the Cirde of Sths contains the Sacred Geometry pattem of a Pentagon

and Pentagram. The angles people are more familiar with in a Gann Wheel cannot create Figure IO.2O. Notice the order of movement or the sequence of numbers marked from 1-2-3-4-5. You do not move sequentially dockwise or counterdockwise within this cirde to reveal a Pentagon. Our study of Astronomy will explain this in detail for you.

1. FUNDAMENTAL FREQUENCY AND HARMONIC OVERTONES FOR CYCLE ANALYSIS

Five months ago, on LinkedIn, 1 hit the post button at about 1:3O a.m. in the early hours of May I4, 2OI8. By 6:3O p.m., after the day’s trading session, the chart in Figure IO.2I had been passed around to 873 Portfolio Managers, 433 CEOs, 2IO world banks, 2 Central Banks, and a host of traders. At the time 1 was still in my first year with LinkedIn and only had a small gathering of people in my network. The chart in Figure IO.2I was beginning to catch on fire for a IO-Year U.5. Treasury Yields chart with just one cyde wave added. The number of views continued to mushroom around the world over the next ten days. It was new and showed a cyde that went back to the mid-I97Os. 1 knew when 1 posted the chart that this was one of the most difficult data sets in which to hunt for cydes, but 1 had no idea there would be such interest in how this cyde was created.

1 used harmonics and the physics properties of sound. The Wall Street firms were dearly trying to duplicate the chart as they kept coming back. It went viral in Italy through top designer houses like Gucci and Salvatore Ferragamo. 1 chuckled, thinking that 1 could be making market calls for dothes. The top number of viewers in New York, Boston, London, Toronto, and Australia were soon surpassed as Pisa, Lucca, Livomo, Turin, Milan, and Siena created a new wave

of viewers. 1 knew the chart would be difficult to simply copy because the cyde was a composite of harmonic cydes.

Our financial industry uses cydes rooted in the physics principles of mechanical waves and bouncing springs. We have been stuck in this manner of thinking for a long time. Markets in my opinion do not move in just this theory of cyde action. There are other wave theories we should be exploring and using in our work.

Harmonic Cydes are different than mechanical cydes.

When a guitar string’s opposite ends are fixed, they do not move. However, the wave action does not suddenly die because the string creating the sound has fixed ends. You could think of the entire crash in the DJIA from I929 to the bottom as a string with fixed-ends as an example. The price high and extreme low are fixed prices forevermore now, but the ripples and vibrations the crash projected into future price swings went on for years after the event. Figure IO.22b shows a string with a fundamental frequency and three different harmonics. The fundamental is what you would hear if 1 pulled the string up and let go of it. We know it would drop down below the center line that is the former resting position of the string. But the sound we hear is not like a tuning fork that resonates at a single frequency; a tone has depth to the sound.

As the energy is dissipated, the string’s wave action now divides into half. The wave action folds back on itself and a midpoint forms where the wave action creates a still pivot point on the string’s center axis. The string then folds back on itself again into thirds. There are now two pivots that stay still between the fixed end points. The string keeps folding back on itself increasing the frequency and hence the pitch. But the overtones of the higher order are always related to the fundamental or longest wavelength.

I4I

The fixed ends and points at equilibrium that form as the wave sub- divides are called nodes. At the maximum amplitude these extreme peaks and troughs are called the anti-nodes. The photo from the Toronto Science Center in Figure IO.22a compares an actual sound wave to the theoretical wave.

An excellent I3-minute video to help your understanding using a blackboard to explain the concepts is offered by KhanAcademy.° They also offer a 9-minute video that looks at the kind of wave action that occurs when you blow into a Coke bottle. Air goes in the bottle, hits the bottom, and bounces back out again producing a tone. The video is well worth the visit as a refresher of the basics.”

Regardless if a tone is created on a guitar, a dosed-ended system, or on an open-ended system, like a pipe organ or a Coke bottle, it is the additive properties of these waves that are different than what our industry uses today based on principles of mechanical wave action.

There are many interesting academic research projects underway. Asan example, in February 2OO9, astronomers at Stanford University found the fundamental frequency of the Sun to be I44 Hz. (I2 x I2 = I44... again.) This field of study is called helioseismology.®

Why are acoustic waves different than those applied in our industry today?

In the I8OOs the mathematician/physicist Fourier answered a question that was not understood at that time. The question was, Why

does the adding of harmonic overtones not change our perception of the pitch of a note? Fourier realized that if you add a harmonic to a fundamental, the resulting wave will have the same period as the original fundamental wave, regardless of how many harmonics you add to the fundamental.

Figure IO.23 demonstrates that if you look at f2 alone, you see that

Figure IO.23. Fundamental with Overtones.

J2 has a shorter period than JI, the fundamental. While the basic period gets shorter, when you add all the harmonics to the fundamental to- gether, you still have a wave with a period equal to the original fun- damental wavelength. This discovery by Fourier is why the study of harmonics and the pattems they produce is called Fourier Analysis.

It is the additive result of all the selected overtones plus the funda- mental that we will apply to the markets. Markets move to harmonic wave action more often than to the summation of waves with random fixed periods.

harmonic (or first overtone) with a wave of twice the frequency, f2, then f3, [4, etc. the cydical wave that forms is called a sawtooth wave shown in Figures IO.23 and Figure IO.24.

Figure IO.24 is an actual sound wave being recorded scientifically. It is showing the resonating first six harmonics of the fundamental frequency. The bottom graph in Figure IO.24 is the wave pattem when the six overtones are added to the fundamental wave. This wave pattem is called a sawtooth wave.

We can also add together just the odd-numbered harmonics, called partials. If we added eight odd-numbered overtones together with the fundamental, we would create the square wave seen in Figure IO.2S. We are not going to use partials, but the wave action in Figure IO.2S reminds me of a stochastic flutter pattem.”

In my book Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional—2znd Edition you can find the European Wheat Prices from ISOO to I869. The chart is repeated in Figure IO.26. The chart was the original work of Edward Dewey who founded the Foundation for the Study of Cydes. The dotted line is his defined cyde with a fixed period. There are cyde shifts displaying both left and right translation, but the chart remains a valuable study for wheat. It is important work; however, look at the price action itself. Now that you know what a harmonic sawtooth wave pattem looks like when we add the har- monics to the fundamental, we can see that the price action of wheat is like a sawtooth wave. Not only do agricultural markets track harmonic wave principles, but financial markets do as well.

The most difficult market in my opinion for cyde analysis is for the

So, the first step is to ask the program (Timing Solution) to find the cydes using Fourier Covariance with a minimum of 4 harmonics and a maximum of 8 harmonics. For this example, 1 am using a monthly data set as a line-on-dose number series for the program to use. The program is very fast and gives a Spectrum Analysis of the cydes for the data in Figure IO.28 ina matter of seconds. The cydes of interest in the graph are the higher peaks in the spectrum graph. Notice the x-axis is a timeline from shorter cydes to longest. 1 dick on the peaks for 6.34 years and I2.7O years as a start.

requires further evaluation. The results are added together, creating the final sawtooth wave that was in Figure IO.2I (repeated below); this is important. Notice the cyde has a longer duration in the upbeat than the cyde duration of the dedine. Try duplicating this cyde result from just fixed period cydes using conventional industry methods and Hurst’s Summation principles. It cannot be done. Markets move to harmonic rhythms, and the Treasury markets tend to track harmonic principles more so than any other market.

W. D. Gann repeats himself often in his books to tell us that he wants us to study the principles of sound. But we have not understood him because what he created was more of a puzzle than dear educational guidance. The title “Tunnel Thru The Air” gives the key concept

that he repeats his entire life: that the power is in the air. (It also refers to the channels of angles that he creates across a chart.) Gann was trying to tell us that the methods he used depended on harmonics. He referred to harmonic principles numerous times. For example:

* The great law of vibration is based on like producing like. Like causes produce like effects. Wireless telegraphy, the phonograph and the radio are based on this law. (Tunnel Thru The Air, p. 77).

Gann repeats himself: * Law of Vibration is the fundamental law upon which wireless

telegraphy, wireless telephones and phonographs are based. Without the existence of this law the above inventions would

have been impossible. (Ticker & Investment Digest interview,

December I9O9, p. S2).

Gann repeats himself again and this is perhaps the most important

quote you read to begin Chapter IO:

Radio works as the result of sound waves which once set in motion

in to the same wavelength. You cannot see these sound waves, but you know they work... This is the greatest proof of the unseen forces being the most powerful. You cannot see the air waves or sound waves, but you can hear them, and you know they work. You cannot see the Divine force that is in the air, but it is there and all powerful, and it will work mirades for you if you will have faith and pati it tito action. (The Magic Word, p. S9):

CHAPTER II

Gann Geometric Basics

“From all these numbers Mr. Gann erects his geometrical figures. He has a big, ponderous volume filled with these figures— squares, angles, pyramids and cirdes—and whenever he wants to know anything he tums to a certain geometrical figure and puts his finger on the answer.” —W.D. Gann, “Sees the Kaiser Shot While Trying to Flee His Prison,”

Milwaukee Sentinel Magazine, January 5, I9I9.

“There are three important points that we can prove with mathematics _

or geometry: the Cirde, the Square, and the Triangle.” —W. D. Gann,

Speculation A Profitable Profession: A Course of Instructions on Grains.

Lesson 3: Forecasting Rules for Grain Geometrical Angles, p. 4.

“There are three dimensions which we know how to prove—width, length, and height. We use three figures in geometry—the cirde, the square, and the triangle. We get the square and triangle points of a cirde to determine points of time, price and space resistance. We use the cirde of 36O-degrees to measure Time and Price.

There are three kinds of angles—the vertical, the horizontal, and the diagonal, which we use for measuring time and price movements. We use the square of odd and even numbers to get not only the proof of

market movements, but the cause.” —W.D. Gann, Course Four. The _

Basis of My es Stock Course, November I93S.

What has been misleading for the Gann community’s beginners is Billy Jones’s addition of a square and triangle on top of Gann’s cirde of I2 that has 36O inner subdivisions. The problem will be demon- strated for you.

Nikki Jones said that they found the symbol one aftemoon on an outing and thought it was cool, but the image of a square and triangle comes from the practice of astrology and it is used within a cirde of zodiac signs to determine aspects or angles of separation between planets.

Is Figure II.1 the correct symbol to denote Gann Analysis? 1 think not. Squaring the cirde has a mathematical answer that does not look like the astrology version of aspects within a zodiac wheel. We primarily use Billy Jones’s overlay when an outer ring, such as a cirde of calendar dates, is added, for example, to set a starting date and find the angle of separation for the next, all calculated from within the outer cirde. The other calculations, such as those in the Square of Nine, must be read from the center to the outer angle. The Billy Jones template only helps you to easily draw a radian line from the center to the 9O° angle or trine. Where is I44° in the Billy Jones diagram? Why are semi-square angles of 4S° missing?

Figure II.2 is mathematically correct. Halve the cirde. Then, define half of the diameter of the cirde to create the height of a triangle with

a 9O° angle with the center. The square is a Pythagorean exercise. It equals the square of the sum of the other two sides. 1 know the hy- potenuse of the triangle will equal 1.6I8. 1 know the angles in the lower comers of the triangle have to equal SI.8O. Why?

The Freemason logo in Appendix E can create the required math, but the problem in Figure II.2 of squaring the cirde cannot be done by using a compass and straightedge. Billy Jones was avoiding the problem. The square root of phi is not an algebraic number. Phi is an irrational number that can only be solved by use of geometric ratios. The Freemason logo can be scaled to the size needed solving for the irrational number. The cirde cannot be squared in Eudidean space, but it can be in non-Eudidean hyperbolic geometry as there are no true squares in the hyperbolic plane. Quadrilaterals are used meaning all sides are congruent and all angles are congruent, but the comers are less than 9O degrees on a hyperbolic plane. Chapter I6 will discuss how trines and squares operate along different vectors when we cover the Law of Vibration.

Figure II.3 is a 36O° cirde divided equally into eighths. We all recognize that this subdivision of the cirde creates radians separated by 4S° and 9O° angles. Angles 4S, I3S, 22S, and 3IS form a square.

Figure II.4 shows 36O° divided by S2. We must add a template to divide the space by 6 if we want to create trine angles. They will not fit on the cusps of a cirde subdivided by S2. To be very dear about this, one point of the triangle is at ‘o’ and the two other points of the triangle fall between angle labels. Drawing the triangle only guides your eye to ensure you skip to altemate radians in the

figure.

Figure II.2. A solution of the problem squaring the cirde cannot be done with compass and straight edge alone because phi is not an al- gebraic number.

There is only one way to subdivide 36O° so that the radians from the center can be used to find squares and triads. It is when we divide the 36O° into 24ths. Figure II.5 demonstrates subdividing the cirde by 24ths and how the square or trine relationships fall on an exact cusp

IS3

of a subdivision within the cirde. That is why Gann had a wheel of I2 that was further subdivided into 24ths.

How can we tell if a stock resonates to a square or trine? Does it matter? It matters greatly. To understand fully we need to wait just a little longer. Let me continue developing the background leading to the chapter on the Law of Vibration.

1 can give you a preliminary test to determine if a stock resonates to squares or trines. Use a major price high in the stock to subdivide the cirde. For example, Figure II.6 is a cirde subdivided into 87ths. The major price high of stock was 87. In Figure II.7 1 took a historic price high of a stock at I33 and used this number to subdivide the cirde. When we overlay a trine template, we see the stock with a high at 87 trades in trine intervals, but the stock in Figure II.7 does not. If the stock trades over IOOO, divide by IO first. Figure II.7 shows that the trine overlay does not mesh with the cusps of a cirde subdivided by II3. This is just a fast guesstimate method to get you started, but it makes the concept dear: Some markets love squares, others love trines—it will not be both.

1 imagine you want to know a few other markets immediately. Okay ... U.5. Treasuries love trines, especially I2O° for retracement swings. The 5&PSOO vibrates on squares. Forex? It depends on the cross 1 am sorry to say. 1 only apply Gann to EURUSD, and it resonates to a square. Oil resonates on squares. Now you can concentrate on the next step in our geometry discussion.*

CHAPTER I2

Geometric Study of Harmonic Division

<span id="chapter-12-a"></span>

A. THE GEOMETRY OF PROPORTION

1 have seen people draw cubes on charts and Sacred Geometry figures over price data, stating that the figures themselves are Gann’s secret. They are not. This does not mean that people who have found their own way to use geometry are not credible, just that they are on their own path and not Gann’s.

Gann used geometry but of far more importance is time. How can you tell when a market will break down through a geometric line or angle? Without an overlay of time cydes to know which points on the extending moving average are important, as Gann called angles of support and resistance, you are really no further ahead. We cannot use geometry alone for market analysis purposes. Understanding how to develop the underlying grid is important. To do this well we need to understand the language of proportion. The language of proportion in the world of Gann is all about harmonic division.

Harmonic divisions divide intervals of space. Space is time. Kepler devotes much effort to the study of harmonic division. We leamed in the last chapter that a harmonic system is created from specific ratios. They are: 5/6, 4/5, 3/4, 2/3, 5/8, and 3/5. Then you realize that 4 and 1 are on a linear scale. You cannot play the 3:4 and 2:3 intervals at one time and expect them to sound pleasant. (The unpleasant noise is called dissonance.) Their harmonic unity only occurs to the whole.

Therefore, Gann is always going back in price and time to find where the origin is to create the whole. Any other division will not be a harmonic division.

Ifyou skipped the last chapter, please go back as much will develop from those harmonic roots. It is essential that you know this: Adding and subtracting harmonic intervals can be counterintuitive. When adding quantities, like lengths of string, addition and subtraction function arithmetically: adding 2/5 inches to 3/5 inches is 5/5 inches, or, t inch. With harmonic intervals, which are geometric relationships, increases and decreases are geometric movements. Therefore, addition and subtraction become multiplication and division. For example, if 1 move up an octave to (1:2), and then want to increase that interval by %, 1 need to take % of %, which means multiplying % by % to get 4. Here is a quick refresher for fractions: % x %4 = (1 x 2) / (2 x 3) = 2/6 = (2/2) / (6/2) = 4. Subtracting intervals is just the inverse: division. Moving a % interval down from 4, 1 would divide 2 by %, giving me %. Here is another quick refresher for fractions; 2! = (1 X 3) / (2 x 2) = %. 1 know that 1 am repeating myself from an earlier section, but this is the primary stumbling block for my students. If you don’t understand this step, you hit a permanent roadblock.

The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines proportion as the “har- monious relation of parts to each other or to the whole.” If you had no

understanding of what was harmonious—and geometric mathematics is not intuitive—you would be finished before you began. Geometry is the field of mathematics that studies proportion. Pro- portion is about ratios. Figure I2.1 by Ali ibn Muhammad al-Gurgani (I339-I4I3), demonstrates geometric proportions in a book about ge- ometry in the Bibliothéque Nationale de France (National Library of France). The spiral grows in harmonic proportion so that each spiral

maintains a like harmonic ratio to the whole and to the prior spirals. This is proportion.

It is one thing to keep the proportions correct within a 2-dimen- sional image, but consider a solid object with an x-, y-, and z-axis. Notice in the Fibonacci Spiral in Figure I2.2 that a “Gann-ish” looking fan is drawn from the bottom right comer. These angles are essential to keep the spiral on the x-, y-axis in proportion when drawn on a

x-, z-axis plane. If you had to draw the spiral as it reflects on an x-, z-axis it would not be an exact copy, but would have to have all the exact same proportions of the original. This is what artists must learn to do. Not only do they keep the ratios of the original but, they must also learn how principles of perspective must be applied when you work on more than a flat plane.

What is perspective? If you draw a solid object like a building that has three-dimensions, you should know how to make the solid object look correct on a two-dimensional surface, so the viewer has a correct impression of the building’s height, width, depth, and position relative to the elements around it. It is all mathematics. 1 do not need to explain terms like vanishing point on a horizon or point of view (POV). It is easier to show you.

Consider the Dodecahedron in Figure I2.3. It has I2 pentagon faces, 3O edges and 2O vertices (comers). The solid is one of the Sacred Geometry solids in a group we know as the Platonic Solids. The other solids are the Tetrahedron, the Cube, the Octahedron, and Icosahedron. Because of the work we did in Chapter IO, we now understand that the Icosahedron can be replicated through musical intervals by creating a single model from different prime-based scales. The minimum required are those of base-3, base-5, base-7, and base-II. Then the figure takes on an exponential growth in size, but the shape itself does not change.

Figure I2.3 uses the Fibonacci Spiral within the solid to map the di- mensions of the solid in perfect proportions on an x-, y-, and z-axis.

Of importance to us later is a simple table that records the number of faces, straight edges, and vertices of each Platonic Solid. With the exception of 2O and 3O, all these numbers have been described in the Pythagorean discussion in the last chapter.

The icosahedron is both the Hexagon and a Cube, meaning that the Square of Nine Gann Wheel and Hexagon are just different angles of orientation. The Hexagon aids us when we are working in multiples

of 6O° (36O/6 vertices = 6O). Figure I2.4 shows that if we tilt a cube so that the diagonal, or opposite comers on the diagonal, are aimed toward the Sun, the shadow below will be a hexagon. Difficulty in seeing that the two are from the same solid? You can take a quick glance at Figure I3.1 in the next chapter which also shows that they are both a cube but rotated to a different angle of view. The ‘eureka!’ moment for me came when 1 finally saw for the first time that the two shapes were shadows of the same solid.

path toward understanding Gann. 1 knew that when you extended the center of the Gann Square of Nine, it would become the pyramid shape called the Tetrahedron. We know that the Pyramid contains numerous Fibonacci relationships. My purpose in studying Gann in depth was to understand why markets had the greatest respect when a Gann confluence zone and Fibonacci confluence zone landed on the same tight price range on the horizontal axis. 1 believe 1 mentioned in my first book, Aerodynamic Trading how an 5&PSOO floor trader named Denny Myers had called me up to ask why 1 was stepping on his levels? We both used different methods and decided to teach each other’s method to one another.

The key here was to identify why some Gann targets, but not all, would fall on Fibonacci confluence zones. The rabbit hole 1 chased down to find an answer was to understand the math conceming the Great Pyramid. Why? The Gann Wheel could create a pyramid shape. It seemed like a place to start. Egypt was already becoming an obsession for me and 1 suppose it was as good excuse as any to learn more. 1 was beginning to understand Gann’s drive to visit Egypt for various reasons we will cover.

The geometry of the Great Pyramid was my new focus of study. All the known measurements from the faces were well-recorded and easy to find. Yes, the Fibonacci ratio is present, as we know. All the numbers would add up, except for the fact that 1 could not get away from what 1 thought was my own math error.

Figure I2.5 shows two triangles on the east and south sides to the middle of each face. The height equals I46.3O23 meters. Linear measurements in meters from the south face of the Great Pyramid at 5 are I79 S8’ 2.4”. Herein lies the problem 1 could not resolve.

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

Figure I2.5. Great_Pyramid_Giza.

The South triangle’s area = 0.6I938. The East triangle’s area equals 0.6I9744.

Since the formula to define the area of a triangle is: area = base x altitude /2, solving for the altitude gives:

South triangle altitude = 0.786424 and the East triangle’s altitude = 0.787O96. But the problem 1 could not resolve is the actual altitude documented is different. South =.78237S and the East =.782933.

The difference was small, but it sent me crazy. 1 went to a small engineering company in Toronto and gave them the recorded metric measurements, but 1 did not state these measurements were for the

Great Pyramid in Giza. The company came back to me with a Mathcad solution in Figure I2.6. They said 1 had made an error as these mea- surements cannot create a 3-dimensional solid—interesting. My next request was to ask them to use their Mathcad program to solve the problem so a solid could be created.

Only then did 1 tell them they were working with the known metric measurements for the Great Pyramid of Giza. Their Mathcad program was telling us that the faces were not flat, but concave, as Figure I2.7 shows in the Mathcad resolution for the South Face of the Great Pyramid.

Figure I2.7. Mathcad Solution.

We need proof. We must prove this in some way. 1 once worked for Eastman Kodak and one of my responsibilities was to serve as photographic technical advisor to the Jet Propulsion Lab. 1 contacted a resource still there and asked if they had any images of the Great Pyramid from space? The contact pointed me to the public file image in Figure I2.8 in the Library of Congress. It is an untouched pho- tograph proving that the Great Pyramid is indeed concave. Sunlight travels at such a distance that light is a laser. It was our shadow on the Moon during an edipse that showed us that the Earth was not flat, but round. It is Tablet V, of the Epic of Gilgamesh from the

---

Old-Babylonian Period, 2OO3-IS9S B.c.E. that is the earliest known reference suggesting that the Earth is round. The Tablet documents a Mesopotamian myth. Now, by following the same principle of using a shadow, the shadow was dearly marking a division down the East face that showed the Great Pyramid was concave.

A few weeks later 1 went to an IMAx film by the National Geo- graphic Society about the Great Pyramid. In one scene they fly a he- licopter directly over the peak of the Pyramid. 1 recall jumping up, prodaiming “Yes!” and just as quickly sitting down in total embar- rassment. What was visibly dear was the star pattem of the faces and the additional proof that the Great Pyramid was concave.

Years later when 1 was given Gann’s suitcase, a yellowed black & white photograph fell out of a book onto the bed in my hotel where the contents were first examined... It was the Great Pyramid. The photograph is in Figure I2.8b. 1 distributed this photograph in my dass as it was always of great interest. At the time 1 thought the pho- tograph was taken about I927, dose to the survey in Figure I2.8c. 1 have since leamed it was doser to I934/5.

But, continuing with this part of my joumey, 1 leamed that the Great Pyramid had extraordinary measurements. Michael Dennin, Ph.D.,a physicist at the University of Califomia, states there have been some remarkable findings in the twenty-first century. The Great Pyramid is the most precise architectural structure on Earth. In its alignment to true North it is within 1 /Goth of a single degree. If you extend the Cardinal and Ordinal points of the Pyramid to encirde the globe, these cirdes will pass through the greatest possible land masses on Earth that can be encirded from any location on the planet. That places the Great Pyramid at the precise center of the world’s land mass.

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

Figure I2.8a. Jet Propulsion Lab Photograph Great Pyramid East Face (U.5. Library of Congress).

The geodetic information will also astound you. One Royal Cubit equals 1.86 feet. The Earth’s polar diameter from the South to North poles is 2S million cubits. The cubit measurement is exactly 1/2S mil- lionth. This means one cubit times 2S million equals the earth’s exact polar diameter.

The length in cubits of the Pyramid is 36S.242. The Earth travels 36S.242 days in one tropical year. The Pyramid length in cubits is exact to the quarter day.

The final measurement is a comparison to the exact coordinate of 29.97924S8° N at the peak of the Great Pyramid. The speed of light equals 299,792,4S8 meters per second. It is also exact.

Gann studied the historic records and surveys about the Great Pyramid with intense interest in London. Why? How does Egypt’s

most remarkable structure on Earth relate to Gann’s financial work? In Gann’s suitcase were notes of Luther J. Jensen. Of all the things Gann could have saved, why did he save a page of Great Pyramid calculations?

Soon you, too, will understand why Egypt is a location of vital im- portance to Gann’s analysis.

B. SACRED GEOMETRY

One of my favorite books, Samuel Coleman’s Nature s Harmonic Unity: A Treatise on its Relation to Proportional Form, is a must-have in your library. The stunning visual images demonstrate harmonic pro- portions in nature, man-made art, Greek sculpture, and engineering that you will be able to fully appreciate. 1 also like the book by Gyorgy Doczi, The Power of Limits: Proportional Harmontes in Nature, Art & Architecture. The more you see visually, the better will be your un- derstanding. These books display harmonic ratios and their division.

While most readers who have been waiting for me to write this book are very familiar with the term and visuals of “Sacred Geometry,” there could be some who bravely dived into this book without knowing very much about the subject. Some of the solids have already been mentioned, but here is a more complete summary list and guide to help you explore this field on your own through the Intemet.

Geometry, like all things, emits a vibration. The harmonic divisions of line and space define nodes. Sacred geometry alone will do little for you in a market context. Yes, 1 likely made several people upset at that statement, but like the Gann templates that show squares of I2 and such, they are useless without applying the time cydes. 1 will show you how the Platonic Solids fit into place in the Law of Vibration when we focus on this topic in Chapter I7.

---

I2. Geometric Study of Harmonic Division I67

Sacred Geometry appears in a small grain of sand, in the largest wonders of the universe, and in everything in between. They all form pattems with harmonic ratios of proportion, revealing that nature is composed from these vibrational resonances. There is always a harmonic connection between the parts to the whole. Bottom line is that Yoda was right: Everything is connected to everything else.

Sacred Geometric Forms:

* The Sphere, a cirde in two-dimensions. * The Cube and its diagonal, the Square Root of Two.

* The Golden Ratio, Fibonacci ratio, Golden Mean, Divine Pro- portion (1.6I8).

* The star called the Pentagram, considered sacred by Pythagoras and Plato.

* The twelfth term in the Fibonacci Series I2 “raised to a higher

power” = I44. ”Raised to a higher power” has a double meaning here.

* The Square Root of 3 and the Vesica Piscis. When two like cirdes with the same radius are drawn and positioned so the outer edge of the second cirde overlaps the center point of the first, the Vesica Piscis is the inner ellipse (think football shape, or the tight eye of Horus) that forms between the two cirdes. (Also see Flower of Life.) Within the geometric football are two equi- lateral triangles which we know have inner angles of 6O° at each apex.

* The Spiral. We have all seen the spiral generated by a recursive Figure I2.9. Sacred Geometry. nest of Golden Triangles to form the Nautilus sea-shell spiral.

* The Toroid. If you think of a donut shape, you have the concept

---

of rotating a cirde about a line tangent. A music lattice will create a torus shape where the center touches all the rotated cirdes.

* Recursive Geometries and Fractals. Easiest description is a cirde with three equally spaced cirdes within it. Subdivide those cirdes into threes again. This is an example of Recursive Geometry. Islamic Art and Islamic architecture widely demonstrate this Sacred Geometric form.

* Perfect Right-Triangles. Right Triangles whose sides are whole numbers with proportions of 3:4:5, 5:I2:I3, and 7:24:2S as ex- amples. The 3:4:5 triangle is in the King’s Chamber of the Great Pyramid.

* The Platonic Solids. The primal crystal pattems within minerals are perfect examples. They are the solids: Tetrahedron, Cube (Hexahedron), Octahedron, Dodecahedron, and Icosahedron. These are the only solids known as the polyhedral made from the same equilateral and equiangular polygons. The cube and octahedron can be created by connecting the midpoints of the faces to the other.

* There are I3 Archimedean Solids. They all have 2 or more regular polygons such as the triangle or square in their construction. Just do a search and the images are very cool.

* Metatron’s Cube. This one is a must to look up on the Intemet. It contains 2-dimensional images of the Platonic Solids. We will retum to this geometric pattem.

* The Flower of Life can be found etched on the walls of the temple of the Osireion at Abydos, Egypt. It is said to contain the tem- plates for the five Platonic Solids.

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

This simple list is enough to get you lost for days on the Intemet. You will be leaming about the building blocks within nature. An- alysts in our industry have different ways of using Sacred Geometry. If you know the basics you will recognize the principle that someone

is graphically applying in their chart work

C. EUCLID PROPOSITIONS APPLIED TO MARKETS

Eudid of Alexandria (3OO B.c.£.) is called the father of geometry. He wrote eleven books about geometry that mathematicians view as one of the most significant contributions to the history of mathematics. Eudidean geometry is important to us. He was also the first author to discuss perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, and number theory. 1 find it interesting that he even touched on spherical geometry because planes that can touch do not fit within Eudid’s Propositions, nor do conic sections. He had literally pushed his thinking beyond linear flat plane concepts in his earlier work.*

Eudid’s Propositions 5 and 6 from Book IV, and Proposition 9 from Book 1 of Eudid’s Elements will be applied to three different markets. As mentioned at the start of the chapter, the reason geometry is so important is that geometry is the language of harmonic proportion. Now we will apply it.

INSIDE THE CIRCLE (The Elements, BOOK IV: PROPOSI- TION 6) APPLE (AAPL)

Figure I2.IIa shows the chart for Apple (aaPL) ina weekly bar chart. The Eudid Proposition we will apply is to construct a square inside of the cirde. The angles defined will be used to create trendlines on both the bottom to top, and top to bottom diagonal axes.

The cirde in Figure I2.IIa has radius AB where the length of the radius was created from the center at point B to a price pivot high at E. Point E marks the end of the swing up before a price consolidation.

We then draw a second cirde in Figure I2.IIb. The center of the second cirde must touch the arc of the first cirde. The size of the second cirde does not matter, provided it is larger than the first cirde.

In Figure I2.I2 the second cirde is simply copied and pasted on the far right. Again, the center of the copied cirde must touch the arc of the first cirde and be on the horizontal axis created from the second diameter passing through the center of the cirde. The center of the third cirde is also on the same horizontal level as the first cirde’s radius AB. (Figure I2.IIb) We can now draw a vertical line bisecting the intersecting points of the two larger cirdes as demonstrated in Figure I2.I2.

Figure I2.I3 shows how the square can now be inscribed within the original cirde by simply drawing four lines to connect the x—y axis where they bisect the cirde.

Now that we have applied Eudid’s Proposition we can draw di- agonal lines to be used for trend analysis, levels of support and re- sistance, and for drawing channels that have a greater meaning than arbitrary angles. Both diagonal directions are applied in Figure I2.I4. How is it that the market respects these lines? You will recall that the

first decision made was to select a swing created by the market. Ev- erything relating to the inner coordinates and angles will have a rela- tionship to a later calculation. Is this just creating a 4S-degree angle? No, and this will be demonstrated in the last example. By the way, the center football within the overlapping second and third cirdes is the Sacred Geometry figure called the Vesica Piscis.

II. EUCLID PROPOSITION: CONSTRUCT A SQUARE INSCRIBED INSIDE THE CIRCLE (The Elements, BOOK IV: PROPOSITION 6) EURJPY

Figure I2.IS is the EURJPY market in a 3-week bar chart. We will repeat the steps from the first demonstration by selecting the radius AB to draw the first cirde. AB is a prominent swing down for the Euro Currency and should produce some interesting harmonic divisions.

The second cirde’s radius begins its center on the arc of the first cirde, horizontal and bisecting ‘A.’ The cirde just needs to extend past ‘A.’ A copy is then made of the second cirde and pasted so that the third cirde’s center is on the same axis as ‘A’ with its center on the outside arc of the first cirde. A vertical line is now drawn that bisects the connecting intersection points of the second and third cirdes.

We can now easily draw the desired square as shown in Figure I2.I6.

Figure I2.I7 uses line segment AB from the bottom or south point of the square to the east point of the square to set the angle that will be used to create the Fibonacci diagonal channel. Be careful that the angle does not change as you select your start. By retaining the angle of line segment AB in Figure I2.I7, the dashed line of the upper channel is placed on the price high just behind ‘A’ at the center of the first cirde. 1 deliberately did not use the price high at ‘A’ to start

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

the channel because the pivot high behind it shows that the market respected this angle during the Euro rally against the Yen for two years. The bottom of the channel line is the swing high that follows the price low marked ‘B.’ The advantage of using a known or copied angle is that we only need a single point to create the trendline and channel angles.

The Fibonacci ratios from the same diagonal channel angles were dearly still a factor within the price action of the EURJPY when it was captured. More recent data showed that angles in this chart from the same channels remained actively in use by the market.

The channel extensions in Figure I2.I7 are the Fibonacci ratios relative to the channel at 6I.8 percent and equality or IOO percent, and then an additional Fibonacci ratio is added to IOO percent. The chart in Figure I2.I7 does not display all the Fibonacci ratios 1 normally use. Depending on the price range, 1 will use 38.2, SO, 6I.8, IOO, I38.2, ISO, I6I.8, and 2OO. 1 rarely need to extend beyond 2OO percent. Normally 1 just repeat these steps to create a new channel.

Important: Do not remove the first set you created. Add additional Fibonacci ratios to the first series as a first step, and then create anew channel with a different start and width. The reason you want to keep the first channel and its ratios is that you may have a confluence target on a diagonal when you repeat the steps using new data. That will give you more valuable information than using a single channel line on its own.

Guess the secret is out now. 1 have taught traders who were adamant they wanted nothing to do with Gann. But these people really liked this method. They were being taught how to use angles and ratios in their analysis. When they were ready and asking for more, they found they had already been introduced to a few simple

concepts that made stepping into the world of Gann analysis much easier.

Figure I2.I8 shows an application 1 use often. It is the same EURJPY chart displayed in Figure I2.I7, but 1 create a Fibonacci Channel on the diagonal using a different method. First, on the horizontal, create a range with Fibonacci subdivisions from the middle of the cirde to the bottom south comer (point ‘A’) of the square. Use only 38,2, SO, and 6I.8 percentages as shown. This is subdividing the radius of the cirde and has nothing to do with price.

A diagonal channel is created from line segment AB down to Tangent A’B’ which is the straight line that touches the cirde on just one point of the cirde’s arc as marked. The range of this channel is used to create the diagonal Fibonacci extension ratios beneath it.

Next, draw a rectangle whose top is from the horizontal SO percent line to the right comer that will touch the line marked ‘Ar.’ It does not matter where along this line the rectangle has to be drawn to connect. It will only touch at one point on the tangent line labeled Tangent A’B’. Where you stop will have nothing to do with the price data set. Now the channel width has been set and the Fi- bonacci ratios extend on the diagonal from this channel in the correct proportions.

Notice that the price action fails just below the SO percent re- tracement, so in this example it is dear that the price was not con- sidered; the price highs do not touch the top of the rectangle. 1 copy/ paste the first rectangle marked “X’ and swing the copy down from the bottom of the first rectangle ‘X.’ This establishes the correct swing projection for rectangle ‘Y.’ The bottom of ‘Y’ two years later in 2OI2 becomes the significant bottom. Why does this work? Harmonics. The principles we leamed within the music section laid the foundation

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

for understanding that markets move to proportional harmonic rela- tionships. Most markets oscillate on both the horizontal and diagonal proportions. Vertical is a special case, which 1’ll ignore for the time being.

AI in Figure I2.I8 is the first channel defined with a dashed line in black marking the width of that range. The second dashed gray line with arrows shows a projected channel of equality to the first, making it easier to see that the diagonal above it is the 6I.8 percentage rela- tionship to the first channel, equality to the bottom of the gray dashed line, and then I6I.8 and 2OO percent. The 2OO percent diagonal line marks the extreme low where the horizontal rectangle swing defined a target. However, this diagram was created in November of 2OIO for a dass, and the diagrams were given to those students in 2OIO. The target was realized two years later. The price low for the Euro currency demonstrated confluence between the diagonal and hori- zontal axis. While this demonstration is different than Gann methods on the diagonal and horizontal, like Gann analysis, the concept is not complete without the vertical Time Factor.

We will move on to a different Eudid Proposition. In this application we will use simple harmonic divisions from a meaningful start without the need to know that these geometrics have a harmonic relationship. Using a 3-day chart of IBM will show how the market data itself contains all the geometric information we need.

at this pivot. 1 picked price low ‘B’ because it starts the move up after a lengthy consolidation period.

In Figure I2.2O the first cirde was copied and the second cirde (darker) was placed so that its center maps on top of point “B’ and its outer arc bisects price high ‘A’ at the center of the first cirde.

We can now draw a line that bisects the overlapping intersection points of the first and second cirdes in Figure I2.2I. This will equally bisect the radius line AB fulfilling Eudid’s Proposition. We continue.

In Figure I2.22 are two rectangle boxes. The first is drawn from the center point ‘B’ to the bisection line. Copy and paste the first rectangle so that the second rectangle’s top right comer aligns with point ‘A’, the price high on the arc of the darker cirde.

In Figure I2.23 the second rectangle is subdivided into Fibonacci retracement ratios.6I8,.SO, and.382 within the box. The horizontal Fibonacci lines are extended to the right. The range contains the IBM stock price action over a considerable time period.

The diagonal lines running left to right are parallel and equally spaced. As you now know something about harmonic intervals, with these diagonals equally spaced they would be octave relationships. The perpendicular line BA is respected several times as support in the lower box, then as resistance in the higher box. Keep in mind all these angles and ratios of subdivision began with the price swing selected in Figure I2.I9. Everything added to Figure I2.23 has a harmonic proportion to the first line BA.

IV. EUCLID PROPOSITION: CONSTRUCT AN ANGLE BISECTOR FOR A GIVEN ANGLE (THE ELEMENTS: BOOK 1: PROPO- SITION 9) IBM

We will continue to work with the IBM 3-day chart, but this time the

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

task Eudid gives us is to “Construct an Angle Bisector for a Given Angle.”

This exercise will be more focused on angles. Figure I2.24 shows angle zABC is created where BA is the same line we selected to start the previous example.

The cirde in Figure I2.24 has a center at B. The radius of the cirde was defined by selecting the price points marked with black arrows. The black arrows point to a price high on the left and the right side shows a pivot low. You do not necessarily have to pick a high/low combination.

In Figure I2.2S the second cirde is a copy/paste of the first. However, if you look dosely, you will see that the second cirde has three points that touch the first cirde drawn. The new cirde has its center touching the outer arc of the first, it touches B and it must have an intersecting point on both the first cirde and line segment BA.

Figure I2.26 shows the cirde copied again and placed above the other two cirdes. Notice that it is placed so that it touches the center of the first cirde at point B. It also touches a swing high that leads to a sharp drop. By connecting the points Adef an equilateral triangle can be defined. The angles zdBf and zfBe solves the Eudid Propo- sition by defining line segment Bf. Triangle A Bdf will be congruent with triangle A Bef which just means they are equal.

Now that we have satisfied Eudid’s Proposition we can do some interesting analysis. In Figure I2.27 a diagonal Fibonacci channel is drawn where the initial channel width is created from the two single points at the black arrows. The diagonal channel then defines the width needed to project proportional Fibonacci parallel lines above the anchor channel. The lines were originally created when the market was at price high A. This is important as IBM uses the channel lines

at price points ‘a’ through “g.’ Do not read data and reactions behind price point A, because they are working on different geometric har- monics. (Fibonacci students of mine please note: This is why we never use data that has been retraced or that is behind the price swings to start the calculations.)

Another channel using the exact same price points at the black arrows is used to create the dedining parallel Fibonacci lines in Figure I2.28.

Figure I2.29 shows that a horizontal Fibonacci range was drawn. This part is important to ensure you are still working with harmonic proportions. The top of the horizontal Fibonacci channel starts where line segment AB intersects the upper diagonal channel line. With that established first, the lower range can be set to the point on the lower diagonal channel marked by the lower black arrow, vertical to point D. IBM uses the horizontal channel on several future occasions as support and resistance.

CHAPTER I3

Other Geometries: The Ellipse, the Helix, and Pentagram

A. THE ELLIPSE AND NON-EUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY

In Chapter I2 we looked at Eudid Geometry that applies math on a flat plane of infinite length. In contrast, elliptic geometries are dosed and of finite length. The underlying premise of non-Eudid geometry is that two straight lines on the same plane will always meet. Eudid geometry can only think in terms of straight lines and arcs to infinity; non-Eudid does not fit in any of Eudid’s Propositions. Non-Eudid geometry is all about the math within cones.

With minimal programming skill we can create three-dimensional models using OpenSCAD to study geometry visually. The illus- trations 1 created and the code you can use have been induded in this discussion. The fun part about OpenSCAD is having the ability to easily rotate the x-, y- and z-axis by just putting your mouse on the background, holding down the left button, and then rotating the grid to any new angle of view that you want.

Figure I3.1 proves again that the Square of Nine and the Hexagon are both cubes but on different angles of view when rotated on the x- and y-axis. To create a simple cube in OpenSCAD use this code on the line after the dots... cube([4,4,4]).

Understanding the rotation is important and will be very important in Chapter I6 when we study the Law of Vibration.

Now let’s take a visual look at non-Eudid geometry. We can create all four figures—the cirde, ellipse, parabola, and hyperbola—

by creating a conic model with four slices as demonstrated in Figures I3.2 and I3.3.

I3. Other Ge0metries: The Ellipse, the Helix, and Pentagram

The r0tati0n in Figure I3.3 0f the f0ur slices 0f the c0ne sh0ws h0w the ge0metries 0f a cirde, ellipse, parab0la, and hyperb0la are related. Weare interested in the cirde and ellipse, th0ugh cydes emulate the parab0la and hyperb0la by cirding back fr0m the right side 0f the page t0 the left again in an endless l00p.

We can see that the ellipse is a shad0w 0f a cirde. A cirde 0nly has 0ne dimensi0n. An ellipse, being the shad0w 0f a cirde, is als0 0ne-dimensi0nal. The difference is in the number 0f f0cus p0ints. The ellipse has tw0 at p0ints ‘a’ and ‘b’ in Figure I3.4a. The angle 0f the slice thr0ugh the c0ne that creates an ellipse has limits—a flat angle takes us back t0 a cirde; t00 steep an angle and we are creating a parab0la. A slice straight d0wn defines hyperb0lic space. All f0ur ge0metries will eventually f0ld back 0nt0 themselves. A new the0ry 0f the universe is gaining credibility: that space is n0t infinite, but finite due t0 the f0lding back principles 0f n0n-Eudid ge0metries.

An ellipse 0n a 6O° angle creates the ideal pr0p0rti0ns f0r precise harm0nic intervals. The ellipse s0 described will als0 exhibit intemal relati0nships with Fib0nacci rati0 pr0p0rti0ns. (As example lines B:C sh0uld l00k very familiar t0 y0u.) 1 did n0t list all the harm0nic in- tervals that these subdivisi0ns create in Figure I3.4a; just en0ugh f0r y0u t0 see that the Pytha90rean intervals are present. F0r analysts deep int0 ge0metry applicati0ns 0n charts, just kn0w that the ellipse sh0uld be drawn at a 6O° angle always. 1 have n0t studied cydes fr0m the intemal harm0nic intervals, th0ugh 1 am very aware 0f their presence and why the ellipse is 0f great interest f0r s0me traders.

Figure I3.4b is the EURJPY ina 2-m0nth bar chart. Y0u will see that the detailed figure fr0m I3.4a has been used t0 0verlay the EURJPY data. The ellipse itself must be tilted 6O°. The angle was drawn 0n the chart, and then the image was put 0ver the graph. The difficulty

in all s0ftware pr0grams t0day is that vend0rs d0 n0t realize that the width-t0-length rati0 0f the ellipse itself sh0uld be fixed. With0ut a way t0 measure the units 0f length and width, 0r have it aut0matically pr0p0rti0ned t0 what is sh0wn in Figures I3.4a and I3.4b, it is nearly imp0ssible t0 use it c0rrectly. 1 kn0w my actual ellipse 0utline is a tad funky. 1 had t0 use a French curve within s0ftware, and it was a t0ugh challenge t0 c0nnect the required d0ts 0f the ellipse in a sm00th arc. But this diagram is accurate and gives all the c0rrect pr0p0rti0ns. Figure I3.4b is helped by the imperfect ellipse arc line, as it is dear that the inserted ellipse 0n the chart is the 0riginal drawn in Figure I3.4a. If y0u d0 apply this ge0metry, the 6O° tilt 0f the midline axis is a must—that is, the line fr0m XI t0 X2. The sharp dedine in the Eur0 Currency against the Japanese Yen dr0pped t0 the midline and 0uter dimensi0nal b0undary 0f the ellipse. Pe0ple wh0 use this t00l find it 0f value. We can see that extending a right-angled line fr0m X2 and the 6O° centerline fr0m XI t0 X2 pr0vides a maj0r trendline 0f resistance which EURJPY is tracking. 1 d0 n0t use this meth0d as Iam unable t0 pl0t and maintain the c0rrect pr0p0rti0ns and angle in my charts. This is n0t a rand0m t00l that just happens t0 be el- lipse-shaped in any rati0 f0r its length t0 width.

Each ge0metric relati0nship 0f the butterfly’s size, angle change, and wing pattem must remain true t0 the ge0metric laws 0f pr0p0rti0nal ge0metry as we see in Figure I3.6. The mathematics required by hand is a staggering acc0mplishment. It can 0nly be acc0mplished using pr0p0rti0nal ge0metry.

Nature is at the heart 0f Gann’s understanding 0f ge0metry. The Gann Wheels are l0garithmic helix calculat0rs.

Figure I3.7 gives an 0verhead view 0f a l0garithmic helix as y0u l00k d0wn the z-axis. It is what we see when we use Gann’s Wheels. Circular, hexa90n, 0r square pattemed Wheels are all helix c0nfigu- rati0ns. Figure I3.8 sh0ws y0u what happens as 1 r0tate the z-axis t0 bec0me perfectly vertical in the b0tt0m graph 0f the l0garithmic spiral. Rafael Arauj0’s website has an image called L0garithmic Spiral. Fr0m this ge0metry he can create with precisi0n numer0us helix drawings 0f butterflies in flight.’

Figure I3.9 sh0ws y0u h0w a spiral chart 0n an x-axis w0uld devel0p in time. Have we applied this c0ncept t0 any charts in pri0r chapters? Yes. Revisit Figure IO.I4 when a Pytha90rean spiral was being pl0tted. The 0verhead view 0f the helix was 0n the z-axis, and the spiral m0ved f0rward and backwards 0n the x- and y-axis.

The m0st c0mm0n applicati0n will be 0n the y-axis f0r price pr0- jecti0n when we read price targets fr0m Gann’s Wheels. Are Gann’s increasing rings 0f the Wheel’s expansi0n cyde l0garithmic? It’s hard t0 see in a small scale. The best way t0 pr0ve it t0 y0urself is t0 l00k at a market with a wide price range like the Nikkei in Figure I3.IO.

Theref0re, we see the familiar umbrella pattem under 0ur price data 0r vertical lines where the single p0int meets the x-axis al0ng the b0tt0m.

It has been 0ur industry n0rm f0r decades. But what if we are 0verl00king an imp0rtant p0int?

What if the wavelength, called lambda, is n0t always equal t0 0ne? What if lambda is less than 0ne? What if it is greater than 0ne? Figure I3.11 sh0ws us what this w0uld l00k like.

exact cusp, but just past it. This fact is imp0rtant and is the reas0n that there is a l0garithmic fact0r t0 a helix.

The number I9 is a prime number and I9 x I9 equals 36I. If y0u c0uld visualize the square t0 the sixth r00t 0f a c0mplex number 7, in p0lar f0rm... what w0uld it l00k like? In Figure I3.I4 1 have added a heavy black radian with an arr0w t0 mark each 0f the principle r00ts. The c0mplex number 2 equals re’®. It is 0ne 0f th0se funky numbers that d0es n0t exist, s0 we give it the name ‘i’ and carry 0n by just admitting it is c0mplex. Al0ng the way y0u realize that y0u d0n’t have t0 s0lve f0r ‘i’ anyway. The visual- izati0n answer t0 the questi0n 0f the square t0 sixth r00t 0f a c0mplex number all0ws us t0 l00k past all the math. The takeaway fr0m these results is that when they are pl0tted in p0lar f0rm, we can see the di- visi0ns we are familiar with and understand that squares derived fr0m the square t0 sixth r00t are the divisi0ns we are w0rking with every day ina Gann Wheel fr0m squares.

An0ther thing t0 kn0w is that a natural number is called a perfect square if it is the square 0f a natural number. That statement kind 0f f0lds back int0 itself 1'd agree. But it means, theref0re, that 36I is a Perfect Square. Few pe0ple kn0w this t0 be true and th0se wh0 un- derstand its pr0perties tell very few pe0ple. One applicati0n 0f this that 1 use is t0 c0unt the squares in calendar days kn0wing that the square 0f I9, 0r 36I, days fr0m a maj0r piv0t date is m0re significant than 0ther square calendar-day c0unts; it is always a maj0r date t0 watch d0sely. We will 90 int0 the meth0d step-by-step in Chapter 26.

There are a few things t0 kn0w ab0ut squares bef0re we c0ntinue:

The b00k is l0ng 0ut 0f print, but can be l0cated when libraries sell 0ff their st0ck. The b00k is a running lecture by Pr0fess0r C0mfield, wh0 believes that understanding the ancient Greek w0rds 0yx0: and Suvdwers as “cubes” and “squares” 0ffers the 0nly interpretati0n that makes sense. On page 47 0f Plat0’ C0sm0l0gy C0mf0rd qu0tes Sir Th0mas Heath fr0m Greek Mathematics, i, p.89. Heath writes:

By planes and s0lids he [Plat0 in this passage] really means square and cube numbers, and his remark is equivalent t0 stating that, if p*, g” are tw0 square numbers, p”: pg = pq: 7°, while, if p’, 7’ are tw0 cubed numbers, p?: p’g = p’¢:p¢ = p¢: q’, the means being 0f c0urse in c0ntinued ge0metric pr0p0rti0n. Eudid pr0ves the pr0perties f0r square and cube numbers in viii. 11, I2 and f0r similar plane and s0lid numbers

in viii. I8, I9. Nic0machus (ii. 24, 6, 7) qu0tes the substance 0f Plat0’s remark as a “Plat0nic the0rem,” adding in explanati0n the equivalent 0f Eudid viii. 11, I2.

C0mf0rd then states 0n page 47, “This interpretati0n 0f the am- bigu0us w0rds dyx0i and Suvaeeis as ‘cubes’ and ‘squares’ seems t0 be better supp0rted than any 0ther... Here, as in many 0ther places, Plat0 is c0mpressing his statement 0f technical matters t0 such a p0int that 0nly expert readers w0uld fully appreciate his meaning.”

Pr0fess0r C0mf0rd 90es 0n t0 say near the b0tt0m 0f page 47, “The interpretati0n can be further supp0rted by a c0nsiderati0n 0f Adrastus’ treatment 0f ge0metrical pr0p0rti0n. He says that ge0- metrical pr0p0rti0n is the 0nly pr0p0rti0n in the full and pr0per sense and the primary 0ne, because all 0thers require it, but it d0es n0t require them.” *

The square 0f I9 h0lds a special place 0f perfecti0n being 36I. Itis neither the d0uble pr0p0rti0n described by Plat0 as 1, 2, 4, 8, n0r is it Plat0’s triple pr0p0rti0n such as 1, 3, 9, 27- D0uble and triple pr0- p0rti0n is the Plat0nic the0rem 0f harm0ny, but there is an0ther plane 0r dimensi0n. It is the dimensi0n 0f the square 0f I9, a dimensi0n 0nly Nic0machus t0uched up0n, giving a due that there is a third plane 0f numbers.

It is Nic0machus wh0 als0 makes a p0int 1 w0uld like t0 0ffer t0 th0se wh0 believe the 0nly viable appr0ach t0 markets is thr0ugh scientific means. N0 matter h0w hard y0u may stare at the algebraic f0rmula f0r a cirde, it cann0t express the c0ncept 0f a cirde being r0und.

I3. Other Ge0metries: The Ellipse, the Helix, and Pentagram

The square 0f I9 has its 0wn unique pr0perties as a harm0nic series. In Chapter I2, in Figure I2.1 we saw the ge0metric spiral drawn by Ali Ibn Muhammad c0ntaining the pr0p0rti0nal gr0wth 0f intemal triangles. In Chapter 20, Figure 20.I8 will sh0w y0u a m0re detailed c0nstructi0n 0f The0durus’ Spiral. Plat0 writes in Timaeus passages S3C, D the f0ll0wing:

S3C. In the first place, then, it is 0f c0urse 0bvi0us t0 any0ne that fire, earth, water, and air are b0dies; and all b0dy has depth. Depth, m0re0ver, must be b0unded by surface; and every surface that is rectilinear is c0mp0sed 0f triangles. N0w all triangles are derived fr0m tw0, each having 0ne

§3D. right angle and the 0ther angles acute. Of these triangles, 0ne has 0n either side the half 0f a right angle, the divisi0n 0f which is determined by equal sides (the right-angled is0sceles); the 0ther has unequal parts 0f a right angle all0tted t0 unequal sides (the right-angled scalene).

C0mf0rd explains bel0w this qu0te fr0m Timaeus 0n page 2I2: “Plat0 intends t0 c0nstruct his s0lids 0ut 0f triangles with0ut pursuing the analysis 0f the triangles themselves int0 simpler principles. Any rectilinear plane face is ‘c0mp0sed’ 0f triangles, in the sense that it can be divided up int0 triangles; and the triangle, as the surface c0n- tained by the minimum number 0f straight lines, is ‘assumed’ as the irreducible ‘element’ 0f all such figures. Plat0 indicates that there is s0mething arbitrary in starting fr0m this assumpti0n. If planes can be c0nstructed 0f triangles, triangles themselves can be c0nstructed 0f lines, and lines can be expressed as numbers. We have already had a hint 0f this in the phrase “giving them a distinct c0nfigurati0n by means 0f (ge0metrical) shapes and numbers.”

With0ut kn0wing it, Pr0fess0r C0mf0rd had just defined 0ne 0f

the c0re principle the0rems 0f Gann Analysis and a descripti0n 0f the spiral pr0perties 0f Gann’s Wheels.

E. THE PENTAGRAM

Figure I3.15 is an extremely imp0rtant diagram t0 understand. The pentagram c0ntains five G0lden Triangles int0 each p0int with angles 0f 72°, 36°, 72° each. The figure itself is c0nstructed fr0m three G0lden Triangles. C0nnect the apex 0f the tw0 b0tt0m p0ints and this 0utlines 0ne 0f the G0lden Triangles p0inting n0rth. Tw0 0thers 0n the sides p0int East and West.

The figure has a fractal pr0perty. The inner penta90n can be sub- divided t0 create an inverted mirr0r 0f the larger pentagram figure. These inverted interi0r p0ints are astr0l0gical midp0ints. This is where the phrase “wheel-within-wheel” 0riginates. The five p0ints subdivide the 36O° cirde int0 five equal angles 0f 72°.

The ancients saw this figure in the sky. Figure I3.I6 sh0ws three Heli0centric Venus—Earth c0njuncti0ns. We will c0mplete the pen- tagram in this manner. By capturing the ephemeris p0siti0n 0f five successive c0njuncti0ns, we can then draw the pattem. Use the first as the base image. Then, using a transparency image, 0verlay the next f0ur c0njuncti0ns while being careful t0 keep the same registrati0n f0r each image. Figure I3.I6 maps I998/0I/I9, I999/O8/27, and 20OI/O4/O2. Figure I3.I7 adds the c0njuncti0ns 0f Venus and Earth 0n the next culminati0ns 0f 20O2/11/O3 and 20O4/O6/I2. N0w, draw a line t0 c0nnect the c0njuncti0ns in their chr0n0l0gical 0rder. They d0 n0t c0nnect d0ckwise 0r anti-d0ckwise. The time series jumps fr0m side t0 side creating the pentagram d0ck.

CHAPTER I4

The e-Mail read: “Why D0n’t Y0u Ask Her? Elin0r Smith Js Sill Alive.”

It had l0ng since c0me t0 my attenti0n that pe0ple 0f acc0mplishment rarely sat back and let things happen t0 them. They went 0ut and happened t0 things.

—Elin0r Smith

The thrust 0f the engines was incredibly l0ud and the vibrati0n 0f the wheels 0n the runway mercilessly sh00k the entire plane and its passengers. The winter had been particularly harsh f0r the S0uth, and the runway was dearly damaged. Just as 1 began t0 w0nder if this time the plane was taking t00 l0ng t0 rise, the vibrati0ns st0pped. The new f0rces 0f accelerati0n dr0ve me deeper int0 the back 0f my seat as my th0ughts were erased by the hum 0f the engines. My senses retumed as we pulled away fr0m a steep left tum. 1 was heading west t0 Calif0mia fr0m S0uth Car0lina. 1 had fl0wn hundreds 0f times, but never had 1 d0ne this bef0re. 1 was flying acr0ss the c0ntinent 0n little m0re than an email and a weak pr0mise.

When 1 first became curi0us ab0ut Gann Analysis, 1 b0ught a c0urse that 1 f0und 0n the fledgling new Intemet in 20OO. 1 knew n0thing. The c0urse arrived in the mail in several parts, each b0und by a spiral wire. 1 disc0vered later that my c0py was different fr0m the 0nes n0w circulated by Sacred Sciences and Brad C0wen. The first secti0n is always Gann marketing material. In my b00k the first page d0sest

t0 the ring binding sh0wed a newspaper ph0t0graph 0f a brand-new L0ckheed Vega plane with a w0man standing beside it. It was a dif- ferent image than the 0ne in Figure I4.1, but the same p0se.

In I93I h0w many pe0ple 0wned a private plane? The image had a capti0n that said s0mething t0 the effect: “Elin0r Smith t0 Fly f0r Businessman W. D. Gann.” When the package arrived, 1 didn’t kn0w wh0 she was, and 1 didn’t like the fact that this useless scrapb00k secti0n 0f self-pr0m0ting advertisements was in my c0py. The first page met the fate 0f s0 many publicati0ns 0f this design: it s00n became t0m and unattached. Always in the way and always falling t0 the fl00r, 1 finally crumpled it up and t0ssed it int0 the garbage— pr0blem s0lved and 90ne. N0t until years later did that single page begin t0 eat away at me like Dickens’s Gh0st 0f Christmas Past.

There were tw0 really stupid things 1 did al0ng my j0umey t0 study Gann. T0ssing this single page 0ut ab0ut Elin0r Smith cut the deepest, th0ugh it became a blessing. The sec0nd err0r y0u may ask? Taking Gann’s Rec0mmended Reading List fr0m this same c0urse (with his 88 Wall Street address 0n it), mistakenly saving a newer versi0n 0f the list using the same file name, and thinking it was Okay. O0ps. It was 0nly a few m0nths after 9/11 and n0t much made sense in the w0rld. T0 rest0re the file w0uld have meant rest0ring my freshly backed-up c0mputer (the back-up had required twenty-tw0 CDs) and und0ing a h0st 0f Micr0s0ft updates that had taken all night t0

d0wnl0ad thr0ugh my pathetic squawking, screeching m0dem. H0w was 1 t0 kn0w then that the earlier list was n0t in public circulati0n? F0r sixteen years 1 saved that c0mputer and years 0f backups. Y0u c0uld n0t just rest0re a single file fr0m a pr0gram called Drive Image (much later it became Acr0nis). Th0ugh 1 still had the s0ftware, 1 disc0vered that the rec0very pr0cess inv0lved reading the first disk twenty-tw0 times bef0re each CD in the series was inserted in the drive. After rest0ring seven backups l00king f0r the 0riginal file, the drive was fried. At the time, 1 figured that the newer Reading List (with Gann’s Miami address 0n it) was likely better anyway. 1 had already begun purchasing b00ks 0n the Wall Street list, s0 1 figured it was Okay. Nikki J0nes t0ld me that the earlier list did exist, but 1 was n0t ab0ut t0 pay $2S,OOO f0r the right t0 hunt f0r it in Gann’s vault, especially when the b00k 0f greatest value 0n the list was already 0n my b00kshelf (Helmh0ltz).

H0wever, t0ssing 0ut the page referencing Elin0r Smith b0thered me s0 deeply that 1 started t0 research wh0 she was and t0 ask, “Why was she in Gann’s c0urse material?” It was years later that 1 un- derst00d why Gann had selected this newspaper image t0 be the first page 0f his c0urse.

W. D. Gann was the purchaser 0f that pictured brand-new L0ckheed Vega plane. The plan was f0r Elin0r t0 fly it 0n a n0n-st0p s0l0 flight t0 R0me. Elin0r w0uld set the rec0rd as a s0l0 w0man pil0t t0 cr0ss the Atlantic and fulfill her desire t0 raise her name t0 Lindbergh’s stature. The test flight w0uld then pave the way f0r Gann t0 make a subsequent flight with Elin0r as they had been d0ing between New Y0rk and Miami finding a faster way t0 travel t0 the next st0p, Egypt.

On April 2I, I932 Elin0r was interviewed by Grantland Rice, a fam0us sp0rts j0umalist, 0ver the Nati0nal Br0adcasting C0mpany

netw0rk. Elin0r was ab0ut t0 attempt an endurance flight 0n April 23. In the interview she als0 menti0ned that she was planning t0 fly acr0ss the Atlantic al0ne t0 R0me s0metime early the f0ll0wing m0nth in “her” plane. The Grantland Rice hist0rical rec0rds are h0used in the University 0f N0tre Dame.

In Figure I4.2 we leam that Gann was the sp0ns0r 0f b0th w0men pil0ts 0f the April 23, I932 endurance flight that resulted in a new rec0rd.

Gann b0ught the L0ckheed Vega plane in I93I and, due t0 the depressi0n and the c0st 0f the latest equipment Elin0r wanted, the trans-Atlantic flight plan had t0 be cancelled. Th0ugh the I932 flight had set a rec0rd, 1 suspect that it had failed t0 stay in flight f0r the full durati0n needed f0r a flight t0 R0me, and that may have weighed 0n Gann’s decisi0n t0 scrap the plan entirely. Gann decided t0 sell “Elin0r’s plane” as she viewed it. This bec0mes a critical part 0f my st0ry and the key tuming p0int in 0ur discussi0n.

Elin0r flew her first s0l0 flight at age 15 and became the y0ungest li- censed pil0t in the w0rld at I6 years 0f age. Her Federati0n Aer0nautic Intemati0nal license was signed by Orville Wright. Yes, that 0ne. The Wright br0thers, Orville and Wilbur, are kn0wn f0r inventing, building, and flying the first c0ntr0lled flight in Kitty Hawk, N0rth Car0lina, 0n December I7, I9O3. Elin0r didn’t represent hist0ry; she was hist0ry in the flesh. 1 was 0ff t0 meet a living part 0f American hist0ry and c0uld n0t tell y0u if this was real 0r just a dream. H0w c0uld y0u n0t just h0p 0n a plane and 90?

1 leamed that 0n Oct0ber 2I, I928, Elin0r, aged I7, was the first and 0nly pil0t t0 fly under all f0ur suspensi0n bridges 0f Manhattan’s East River (Figure I4.4). 1 mean, think ab0ut it. They didn’t st0p the river’s shipping traffic, she had t0 study the tides, dearance and

it was a neck-and-neck c0ntest with n0 end in sight until New Y0rk businessman W.D. Gann 0ffered t0 sp0ns0r ther b0th if they w0uld make an endurance flight t0gether with aerial refueling - a feat never bef0re attempted by w0men. The rivals dup in N ber and sat their sights 0n the f0rmidable, 420-h0ur w0rld endurance rec0rd sat by hve men, Dale Jacks0n and F0rrest 0'Brine, in July I929.

They t00k 0ff again with0ut the radi0, but then the Sunbeam’s wire rigging started t0 snap, f0rcing an0ther landing.

design 0f each bridge, and understand the water surface air turbulence. That was a daring stunt f0r a teenager and 0ne that has never been repeated. Apparently, Elin0r 90t int0 a t0n 0f tr0uble, but she made such a name f0r herself that the public ad0pted her and demanded she be all0wed back int0 Manhattan after being banned by the May0r. She was a her0. She had the spirit 0f a futures trader and the s0ul 0f a fighter pil0t. Her c0urage and spunk dr0ve me 0nwards. Bef0re she t00k 0ff t0 fly under the East River bridges, the final w0rds she heard standing 0n the wing 0f her plane in the hangar were th0se 0f Charles Lindbergh. He said, “G00d luck, kid, keep y0ur n0se d0wn in the tums.” Pe0ple interviewed at the time say Elin0r and the Wac0 9 s0ared like a c0uple 0f dry leaves in a high wind. T0gether they made hist0ry, and her career t00k 0ff fr0m there attracting the attenti0n 0f several businessmen.

Elin0r Smith was s0 respected in her later years that in March 0f 20OO she was invited at age 89 t0 fly NASA’s Challenger vertical m0ti0n simulat0r at Ames Research Center, M0ffet Field, Calif0mia. She was awarded a certificate that states: “This certifies that Elin0r Smith successfully landed the space shuttle... the w0rld’s largest M0ti0n Simulat0r.” She acc0mplished this 0n her sec0nd attempt. Are y0u kidding me? That’s incredible! 1 read in 0ne newspaper, in the New Y0rk Library’s micr0fiche r00m, that Elin0r flew 0ut 0f R00sevelt Field 0n L0ng Island. That is the same field Charles Lindbergh departed fr0m 0n his hist0ric I927 flight acr0ss the At- lantic t0 Paris. (It was then called Curtiss Field.) 1 w0ndered if they had a museum with any d0cuments ab0ut Miss Smith? Sadly, the field itself was d0sed, and devel0pers had tumed it int0 t0wnh0uses and a sh0pping center.

But staying with it is h0w 1 f0und a website f0r “The L0ng Island

Early Fliers Club.” Sh0ck! Reb0m h0pe! The f0rces 0f the universe had c0me t0gether 0n this day. There 0n the fr0nt page 0f their website was a picture 0f Elin0r Smith. As 1 read the artide with the image 1 gasped... Gann was menti0ned (Figure I4.2).

1 had screen-captured the page, and then pr0mptly sent 0ff an email with questi0ns t0 the generic address 0n the website that simply started with “inf0@.” W0uld 1 ever receive a reply? 1 did n0t even have a c0ntact name.

Tw0 days later my day began with my r0utine 0f c0ffee and checking f0r new messages, when my heart seemed t0 skip a beat. There was an email fr0m the secretary 0f the dub. He explained, “Why d0n’t y0u ask her? Elin0r Smith zs s¢i/l alive.” 1 was given the c0ntact details needed by ph0ne, and suddenly 1 felt 1 had been transp0rted back in time. H0w c0uld such an imp0rtant Gann c0nnecti0n still be with us and n0t be kn0wn?

Elin0r had granted 0ur meeting based 0n a misunderstanding. My references t0 her nurse ab0ut Gann and ab0ut her being his pil0t and h0w excited 1 was yada, yada, had s0meh0w been relayed that 1 had been a fell0w pil0t. S0, the meeting began very p00rly.

It became dear t0 me that s0mething was amiss 0ther than this first misunderstanding. Elin0r l00ped back t0 re-ask the same questi0ns. The nurse explained that Elin0r was beginning t0 suffer fr0m Alz- heimer’s and w0uld tire sh0rtly. 1 t00k respectful n0te and tried hard t0 balance the fractured st0ries 0f her incredible life and my need t0 ask her ab0ut Gann. 1 d0n’t fly but 1 leamed that with the stick f0rward, the n0se 90es d0wn and a plane gathers speed t0 push the Earth away and bec0me airb0me.

1 leamed that Amelia Earhart’s sp0ns0r, Ge0rge P. Putnam, like m0st w0men’s sp0ns0rs 0f the day, made Amelia sign a c0ntract stip-

ulating that he w0uld have the exdusive rights t0 pr0m0te her. Even- tually the tw0 w0uld marry. 1 leamed that, f0r marketing reas0ns, Putman dr0ve Amelia’s schedule s0 hard that she had n0t c0mpleted the required h0urs 0f flight instructi0n needed bef0re setting 0ff 0n her fam0us j0umey. Her engineer Paul Mantz had silently d0ne the landings f0r her. The sad part was hearing that the pil0ts knew Amelia w0uld likely n0t retum fr0m her gl0be-tr0tting adventure. On the insistence 0f Putnam, she had decided t0 stay 0n schedule f0r the press; m0re0ver weight was a pr0blem f0r her plane, and she w0uld leave the much better, but heavier, radi0 behind. (Recently, it has been daimed that Amelia survived, but that she and her plane were taken pris0ners 0f war by the Japanese and that she died at the pris0n camp. There were eyewitness acc0unts that she had been seen in the pris0n.)

Elin0r recalled an Admiral M0ffett fr0m when she was given access t0 the Navy’s pressure chamber and high-altitude flight equipment t0 prepare f0r the altitude rec0rds she br0ke. The Admiral wanted the United States t0 break and h0ld every rec0rd in aviati0n. The expense 0f many rec0rd attempts was Navy-funded until men in the H0use and the Senate wh0 did n0t appr0ve cancelled the funding.

A c0nfusing t0pic kept cirding in ab0ut a Hicksville p0tat0 field. It was ab0ut the third cirde int0 this field that the picture became dear that a Frenchman by the name L0uis Gaubert gave Elin0r her first flight experience at age six. She had never f0r90tten.

Elin0r had male pil0ts as guardians and male enemies wh0 tried t0 kill her career by saying she was a flaky kid wh0 sh0uldn’t be taken seri0usly—s0mething every w0man in a male-d0minated industry can identify with. Then 0ne day, in defense 0f the Wac0’s ceiling limits, Elin0r let 0ut that she had already been ab0ve I2,OOO feet

with0ut 0xygen. The Curtiss C0mpany hired her t0 pr0ve it and t0 build their reputati0n.

1 leamed that Curtiss Field was the place t0 be and t0 be seen. It was fr0m Curtiss Field that Charles Lindbergh, Lt. James D00little, Richard Byrd, and Clarence Chamberlin flew. 1 0nly knew the first and last 0f these names: it was Chamberlin wh0, due t0 engine tr0uble, had failed t0 take 0ff f0r Paris just 24 h0urs bef0re Lindbergh made his successful attempt—a fact 1 recalled fr0m the Hist0ry Channel d0cumentary.

Elin0r didn’t think much 0f “G.P.” wh0 1 s0mewhere realized was Putnam. D0uglas Fairbanks was a wing-walker bef0re the studi0s picked him up as a stuntman. 1 w0uld fill in the gaps in the st0ries later. 1 c0uld see Elin0r was tiring. 1 finally had t0 ask:

“D0 y0u remember the New Y0rk businessman William Gann?”

Elin0r changed the t0pic and pr0ceeded t0 tell me a st0ry ab0ut h0w she t0ld R0ckefeller t0 90 t0 hell when he refused t0 pay an agreed-up0n c0ntract. Apparently, he had later c0me ar0und t0 pay her as agreed, and she was 0ne 0f a handful 0f pe0ple wh0 c0uld make such a daim. We cirded back.

“Gann? Oh yes. He l0ved th0se p0nies. He’d bring bags 0f cash and never came h0me with any 0f them.” She was making reference t0 Gann’s jaunts t0 the islands; it was well-kn0wn Elin0r had pil0ted th0se trips.

1 asked Elin0r if they had planned t0 fly fr0m New Y0rk t0 R0me? “Yes,” Elin0r said, and she dearly became saddened. She went 0n, “Times were very hard then; there was a Depressi0n y0u kn0w. [L0ng pause.] He had t0 cut back 0n expenses t0 where the latest instruments c0uld n0t be b0ught. My daring needed every technical help 1 c0uld get. 1 cancelled the flight. Later he s0ld my plane.”

Elin0r answered, “Well, let me think 0n that.” The c0nversati0n went n0 further. The nurse was giving me signals that my visit was nearing an end. Then, as Elin0r listened t0 me describe Gann and my respect f0r all that she herself had acc0mplished, she seemed suddenly t0 remember s0mething, and tuming t0 her nurse, she asked, “D0 y0u kn0w that 0ld suitcase?” There was a n0d and the nurse left the r00m. When she retumed, she was carrying a very 0ld br0wn suitcase with leather straps. 1 was h0lding my breath.

Elin0r’s nurse sh0wed me t0 the d00r as 1 held Gann’s suitcase tighter than anything 1 had been given bef0re. 1 carried the mem0ries 0f this day that w0uld be with me all the days ahead. 1 was saddened t0 hear that Elin0r needed specialized care and was m0ved t0 a nursing h0me. Then many years later 1 read that she had passed 0n March I9, 20IO. We l0st a giant and a pi0neer wh0 in her way helped t0 build an industry that grew the ec0n0my 0f 0ur nati0n. Th0ugh 0ur time was brief, Elin0r will remain in my heart always f0r her spirit and her amazing j0y f0r life and always living it 0n the edge. S0meh0w her bright spirit helped t0 0ffset the bitter spirit 1’ve carried inside me since 9/11. Her 900dness was that str0ng; str0ng en0ugh t0 c0unter even the great pain caused by such evil.

CHAPTER 15

Gann’s Mystery in a Suitcase: The Unpublished F0rmulae

My retum flight was scheduled f0r the next day, and 1 felt that 1 held my breath all the way t0 the h0tel and thr0ugh the check-in pr0cess. In my mind 1 0nly had 0ne suitcase, Gann’s. 1 had carefully put it 0n the bed and 0pened it. Inside 0n the t0p were scattered pages with Gann’s rec0gnizable writing. There was n0 0rder t0 the c0ntents, and many pages were scribbled 0n with c0l0r markings. Under the papers were small Astr0l0gical Bulletina b00klets that 1 did n0t 0wn 0r kn0w 0f. On the b0tt0m were the Freemas0n artifacts which 1 carefully un- f0lded and arranged 0n the tw0 beds 0f the h0tel r00m. Finally, there were a few m0re l00se pages 0f n0tes. It was a massive haul. “What the heck are a r0pe, a mask, and a small c0ffin d0ing in here?” Later 1 w0uld leam why. One 0f the Freemas0n rituals f0r m0ving f0rward t0 the next degree is a ritual death 0f 0ne’s e90. The length 0f r0pe reflects a Freemas0n dictate that any mas0n near an0ther within the length 0f this l0ng r0pe must be helped. All the artifacts fr0m the suitcase can be f0und in Appendix G. The n0tes are the 0nly thing 1’d like t0 keep private. 1’d like t0 keep them between Gann and myself f0r the time being. 1 have given y0u everything else 1 have 0r kn0w.

1 knew the papers in the suitcase were the m0st imp0rtant items, but they didn’t make any sense t0 me. Why had Gann tried t0 get these papers int0 Elin0r’s hands? Surely Gann w0uld have prepared 0rderly neat stacks f0r her. Elin0r had dearly 90ne thr0ugh them and the disease she was fighting had frustrated her ability t0 see what it all

meant. In her eff0rts they had bec0me t0ssed and scattered. Did Gann regret crushing Elin0r’s dream when he did n0t buy the instruments she needed t0 fly t0 R0me and s0ld “her” plane? Of what value were these items t0 Elin0r 0r t0 Gann t0day?

It t00k me a year t0 put the pages in 0rder and t0 realize that they were different attempts t0 s0lve a math pr0blem relating t0 harm0nics. It t00k an0ther f0ur years t0 figure them 0ut.

As a pil0t Elin0r had t0 have had excellent math skills. My best guess is that Gann was n0t 0nly asking Elin0r t0 help him s0lve a math pr0blem when he passed, but was als0 giving her s0mething he deemed 0f great value. Fate had put the puzzle squarely in my lap.

Gann’s math was dreadful when y0u really checked his figures. In terms 0f m0deling c0ncepts he was what 1 w0uld call a c0nceptual genius. The practical mathematics was much harder f0r him. 1 suspect Elin0r was Gann’s 90-t0 pers0n f0r help 0n such matters. She was silent and had leamed t0 keep secrets flying f0r the big business names 0f her day. We kn0w Gann gambled 0n h0rses, but it s0unds like it was a bigger pr0blem than we realized. Traders have that c0mpulsi0n, and many traders need that adrenalin fix and find it in 0ther ways when their trading is n0t as active.

1 did n0t have the skill needed t0 w0rk with these n0tes. That is the reas0n 1 had t0 study the material 1 shared with y0u in Chapter IO. The skill level 1 needed had t0 answer my questi0n, “What are y0u trying t0 d0, Mr. Gann?” As y0u study and bec0me m0re pr0- ficient in vari0us subjects, it bec0mes m0re and m0re dear h0w the different disciplines are all interc0nnected. One can transp0se fr0m astr0n0mical angles t0 ge0metric rati0s. Music intervals transp0se t0 astr0n0mical distances between planets. A triad m0del can be used t0 visualize the interc0nnecting relati0nships summarized in Figure 9.1.

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

The questi0n was, what was missing fr0m within Gann’s w0rk? Then it hit me. The missing puzzle piece is “Cents.” Everything can be c0nverted between the trine relati0nships except f0r 0ne thing. There is a missing bridge. H0w d0 y0u c0nvert harm0nic intervals int0 angles 0f degrees, minutes, and sec0nds mathematically as a direct f0rmula? This is the puzzle piece that c0mpletes and c0nnects the entire m0del. What we are really being asked t0 d0 is c0nvert cents directly int0 angles with0ut having t0 90 thr0ugh a cirde template where intervals are read fr0m the p0lar graph. The missing bridge is in Figure 15.2. Figure 15.2 is a simplified versi0n 0f Figure 9.1. Gann had n0t finished the w0rk.

Bridging cents, 0r harm0nic intervals, t0 angles w0uld c0mplete the entire triad. Years later six traders were invited t0 attend a 0ne-time special three-day Gann seminar 1 held in L0nd0n’s beautiful St. Pancras H0tel. We had huddled in the Stati0n Master’s R00m bef0re and felt like we were pe0ple retuming h0me. They knew ab0ut the suitcase and they knew 1 had been w0rking with it. They had all at- tended the week-l0ng c0urse 1 gave 0n Advanced Gann analysis, s0 they were pr0ficient with the c0ncepts. 1 wanted t0 teach what 1 had leamed fr0m the final puzzle piece, s0 it w0uld n0t be l0st. 1 gave the f0rmula and descripti0ns t0 them. 1 w0uld later sh0w 0thers in a fast pass 0f an edited 0verhead, but 1 never sent them h0me with the slides 0r f0rmulas. 1 als0 was beginning t0 think ab0ut h0w t0 structure this huge v0lume 0f inf0rmati0n as a b00k s0meday. W0uld it make sense? Is it even p0ssible? H0w w0uld it be received? 1 spent a year in preparati0n f0r a three-day seminar.

The six pe0ple were: Kudakwashe Chinhara, Tim Every, Annette K0berlein, David Nye, and Akhil Patel. There was a sixth, but being fr0m Saudi Arabia he must remain an0nym0us because he is f0r-

bidden t0 study anything t0 d0 with astr0n0my 0r astr0l0gy. One can be arrested f0r such studies he t0ld us. He daimed the r0cking chair in Figure I4.5 as his 0wn, which is the reas0n the picture was taken. With the farm n0w s0ld, 1’m grateful we t00k a picture that captured a m0ment. Y0ur fav0rite chair, Mr. “H,” was saved and m0ved t0 Try0n. It is reserved f0r y0ur retum visit. But we kn0w and h0pe s0meday kn0wledge is n0t s0 threatening f0r any0ne. In my view it 0nly pr0ves G0d exists. All these c0nnecti0ns did n0t happen by accident 0r with0ut a Supreme Engineer as is the view 0f the Freemas0ns. H0w the seminar ended is a st0ry that 1 will share with y0u in the last chapter. We had decided we sh0uld all visit the Freemas0n’s Hall 0f the United Grand L0dge 0f England. 1 knew this b00k must end 0n Chapter 33(°). 1 als0 knew that, t0 apply Gann’s meth0ds, Chapter 32(°) had t0 be a 36O-degree retum t0 the study 0f the first chapter. Gann w0uld have expected it. Y0u see, f0r the Sc0ttish Rite Freemas0ns the highest degree 0f leaming is the 32nd Degree. The 33rd Degree is reserved just f0r the Master 0f a L0dge and their leaming is m0re ab0ut the administrati0n 0f their craft, pr0cedures, and rituals.

What f0ll0wed when 1 retumed h0me surprised me. New c0ntacts 0ut 0f the blue wanted t0 attend my seminar pr0vided 1 taught what was in Gann’s suitcase. N0ne 0f the pe0ple 1 had been with in L0nd0n w0uld have been the leak; Nikki J0nes knew 1 had been given this suitcase. When 1 w0uld say ‘n0’ t0 the emails, the resp0nse was always the same: Then it d0esn’t exist. 1 w0uld tell them that it d0es. (An0ther spy sent fishing.) Well, they w0uld say, have y0u ever taught it t0 any0ne? Yes, n0w 90 away. It br0ught t0 my mind a great line fr0m a c0untry s0ng 1 like, “G0d is Great, Beer is G00d, and Pe0ple are Crazy /”

Figure 15.2. Simplified Triad 0f Gann Analysis.

T0 m0ve f0rward we have a few m0re c0ncepts 1 need t0 give y0u first. They will extend the inf0rmati0n in Chapter IO. N0t take l0ng it will. (1 think that is a Y0da-ism. Appr0priate in this case.) The study 0f harm0nic c0l0r in Tibetan mandalas is imp0rtant. The vibrati0n c0nnects all things.

C0l0r? What’s that 90t t0 d0 with anything? If y0u tum t0 the chapter f0r the 32° candidate in the Bridge t0 Light by Rex Hutchens, a c0l0r wheel is displayed in a Pentagram. C0l0r is a vibrati0n 0f specific frequencies. Everything has a vibrati0n frequency, d0es it n0t? Gann n0tes were marked with cray0ns. | th0ught Elin0r had been adding marks. But when 1 checked, Cray0la Cray0ns were first s0ld in I9O3. They had been ar0und a l0ng time. Gann had c0l0r c0des 0n these n0te pages f0r 900d reas0n.

The issue at hand is that we cann0t simply use degrees. We want t0 end up with degrees fr0m frequencies. Figure 15.3a sh0ws the c0l0r spectrum with a scale in nan0meters f0r wavelength and terahertz frequencies. Keep in mind that as frequency increases, wavelength decreases. The terahertz scale in the middle fr0m less than 30O t0 greater than 15OO is the 0ne 1 f0cused 0n t0 m0ve 0n t0 the next steps. The pr0blem at hand is c0nverting frequencies t0 degrees.

All 0f Gann’s n0tes and Cray0la markings can be summarized vi- sually in Figure 15.3a. These c0l0r spectrum frequencies can then be used t0 c0nvert Terahertz frequencies t0 music pitch in a 36O- degree c0nfigurati0n. The frequencies in Terahertz create the in- tervals and the placement 0f each n0te 0n the c0l0r wheel. Harm0nic frequencies are measured in Hertz, c0l0r frequencies in Terahertz. IHz = IO *THz. The reverse is ITHz = IO’7Hz. Frequency t0 ter- ahertz is m0re inv0lved. Frequency f in terahertz (THz) is equal t0 the frequency fin hertz (Hz) divided by IO'.

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

J (THz) — J (Hz) / IO%

As example, if we want t0 c0nvert a pitch at 30O hertz t0 terahertz:

5 crus = 30OHz / IO% = 3 x IO° THz.

Let’s say we need t0 c0nvert 6 terahertz t0 hertz, the f0rmula we w0uld use is:

= 6THz x IO% =6

_ 2 te ts wae, 5 ay =F cru) X IO”, in this example itis: {.,..

x IO Hz.

Aspect relati0nships thr0ugh c0l0r can be d0ne within this illus- trati0n 0f the harm0nic wheel, but we are m0re interested n0w in the frequencies.

Figure 15.3b is nearly a 9O° view 0f the accurate c0nversi0n. A c0l0r versi0n will be p0sted 0n 32ndJewel.c0m. N0tice the pitches “B’ and “Bp’d0 n0t culminate t0 a p0int. Each 0rb shape f0r the n0tes is a little different and keeps a unique f00tprint 0n the graph. The key takeaway was that the c0l0rs ass0ciated with the pitches 0f the n0tes have an 0rb pr0perty. Each has a bandwidth, but three c0me t0gether as a p0int; y0u guessed it—the Octave, the Perfect Fifth, and the Perfect F0urth. ‘C’ in diagram 15.3b is an example relative t0 the pattems 0f ‘B’ and ‘B)’ (B-flat.)

Let’s jump straight t0 the last c0nversi0n. The c0l0r wheel terahertz frequencies and resulting harm0nic intervals need t0 be c0nverted t0 degrees. The tricky part is rec0gnizing that they have t0 be n0r- malized, meaning the results must all fall within a range 0f zer0 t0 1. Gann had issues with the c0nversi0n fr0m terahertz t0 hertz. Here is the final s0luti0n:

Let’s take 15/8 as the example 0n the 0rb entry 0r cusp 0f pitch ‘B’ Step 1. C0nvert the rati0 t0 a decimal = 1.87S.

Step 2. N0rmalize the decimal int0 an Octave as it must be between 1/1 and 2/1 (Just like the Gann Wheel, as we must n0rmalize several markets.) Take 1.87S subtract 1, equals.87S, the numbers must be between zer0 and 1.0.

Step 3. N0w we can find the degree within a cirde. Take.87S x 36O, equals 315.

Step 4. 315 equals 315°OO’OO”,

Let’s d0 0ne m0re example like I28/8I that is harder. Step 1. C0nvert the I28/8I rati0 t0 a decimal. I28/8I equals 1.S8O2. Step 2. N0rmalize. 1.S8O2 minus 1 equals.S8OO. Step 3. Find the degree within the cirde. S8OO x 36O equals 208.8O. Step 4. We have 208° and decimals 0f.8O.

Step 5. C0nvert.8O t0 minutes. Take 8O x 6O (there are 6O minutes in 1 degree), equals 48OO. Dr0p the zer0s.

Final answer: I28/8I equals 208°48’OO”.

N0w add all the pitches as degrees induding the cusps 0f their 0rb ranges. They equal 3I68°O9’. What’s the significance 0f 3I68°O9’? F0r Gann we will see that this c0mpletes his triad 0f c0nversi0ns because we understand that harm0nic intervals have 0rb pr0perties and we kn0w h0w t0 c0nvert them t0 angles. But there is a greater significance f0r Gann.

Greek Alphabet Gematria is an encrypti0n c0de that all0ws me t0 assign a numeric value f0r each letter. The value has been written in a c0lumn under the letters. Then add them in this manner; the middle

w0rd is IO+8+20O+7O+4OO+20O which equals 888. N0w y0u can d0 the 0thers.

Kupt0g In00vg Xpti0t0s 241172 I82742 6112372 OOOOOO 0O OOOO 00OOOOO l0me) 3° O0 0O OO OO 9O 8OO + 888 + I48O = 3I68

What d0 the Greek letters mean as w0rds? L0rd Jesus Christ.

The 3I68 is the 3I68° t0tal when y0u c0nvert the frequencies t0 degrees. Then y0u need t0 kn0w that there are twenty-tw0 intervals 0f the 0ctave with pairs f0r nearly every n0te because the n0te frequency is like an astr0n0mical culminati0n with an 0rb range. But three have 0nly 0ne c0nversi0n with0ut need 0f defining a frequency range: the Octave, the Perfect Fifth, and the Perfect F0urth. If we had n0t used frequencies 0f c0l0r, we w0uld n0t have f0und the result Gann s0ught. Gann knew it was in there, but he c0uldn’t make the final calculati0n t0 kn0w that the t0tal was 3I68. He had the c0ncept c0rrect. This d0es m0re than c0mplete his m0del. Harm0nic frequencies, then harm0nic intervals, 0r the spread, t0 cents, can n0w be c0nverted t0 angles, and astr0n0mical events that align t0 the fact0r’s price abide acc0rding t0 the m0del we will discuss in the Law 0f Vibrati0n in ChapterI6. It means Time and Price have angle c0ntinuity. This c0ncept will be devel0ped in future chapters.

---

The number 3I68 has s0me interesting pr0perties. As an example, the diameter 0f the Sun is 864,OOO. When divided by 3I68 it equals 272.7272727272... repeated. Numer0l0gy f0r 272 is 0ne. We will t0uch 0n this in near chapters.

The Sun’s Radius is 432,OOO miles, which when divided by 3I68 equals I36.36363636... repeated. Numer0l0gical value is again the number 0ne. The number 311O4 y0u will meet in the next chapter. When divided by 3I68 it equals a time fact0r. The number 3I68 itself falls directly 0n a vect0r intersecti0n within the Law 0f Vibrati0n m0del we will c0ver next.

Imp0rtant. Here is the b0tt0m line t0 all this research. We must n0t 0verl00k this; it is new. Harm0nics need t0 be treated like an astr0n0mical 0rb. We have always th0ught that the interval must be handled precisely as defined by musicians, but the diagram in Figure 15.3b teaches us 0therwise. The 0riginal pitch itself has an 0rb-like pr0perty. Theref0re, harm0nic intervals n0t 0nly have a spread defined by a single line but can be a spread between tw0 c0n- fluence-style bands. Because 0f this new understanding, 1 was able t0 90 back and study the spread relati0nships between Gann and/ 0r Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0nes 0n the h0riz0ntal axis. (See Chapter 4.) By treating the c0nfluence z0ne as the pitch, be it fr0m Fib0nacci 0r Gann’s Wheels, it c0uld be determined that the spreads between c0nfluence z0nes w0uld have harm0nic interval characteristics and

theref0re lend themselves t0 m0re advanced analysis as a l0nger series 0f harm0nics f0r maj0r future price swings. That translated t0 d0llars. Why? We can identify which 0f the c0nfluence z0nes was the maj0r target and define the future maj0r target, n0t just define a grid 0f supp0rt and resistance. 1 had been 0verlaying this inf0rmati0n with Gann analysis f0r years, but 1 never fully underst00d why it w0rked s0 dramatically with markets sh0wing significant respect t0 the targets. N0w 1 did. While Chapter 4 0ffers an intr0ducti0n with0ut descriptive details 0f harm0nics, we will retum t0 this t0pic when we dive int0 Gann Wheel applicati0ns.

1 w0uld highly rec0mmend the w0rk 0f Pr0fess0r Dmitri Ty- m0czk0 0f Princet0n University. His b00k 4 Ge0metry 0f Music ex- pl0res harm0nics and ch0rd ge0metry in c0l0r.* Think 0f ch0rds as intemal price piv0t levels. It is the spread that is 0f interest.

The resuits 0f this investigati0n ace remarkable in many ways,

It appears t0 be a fact that Mr. Gann has devel0ped an entirely new idea as t0 the principles 90veming st0ck market m0vements.

“fy is imp0ssible here t0 give an ade- quate idea 0f the Law 0f Vibrati0n as 1 apply it t0 the markets, h0wever, 0f the principles when 1 state that the Law 0f Vibrati0n is the fucdamental jaw up0n which wireless telegraphy,

"In 0rder t0 test 0ut ‘the efficiency 0f my idea 1 have n0t 0nly pet in ears 0f lab0r in the regular way, but i spent nine m0nths w0rking night and day in the Ast0r Library 0f New Y0rk and in the British Museum 0f L0nd0n, 90ing 0ver the rec0rds 0f st0ck transacti0ns as far back at I820. i have incidentally examined the ma- nipulati0ns 0f Jay G0uld, Daniel Drew, C0mm0d0re Vanderbilt. and all the 0ther ii tant Wail Street manipu- Jat0rs fr0m that time t0 the present 0f Uni0n Facific price t0 and fr0m the time 0f E.

“In 90ing 0ver the hist0ry 0f mar- kets and the great mass 0f related sta- fistics, it s00n bec0mes apparent that certain laws 90vem the changes and vatiati0ns in the value 0f st0cks and there exists a peri0dic 0r cydic law, which is at the back 0f all these m0ve- ments. Observati0n has sh0wn that

markets have n0ticed the ph p 0f ebb and fl0w, 0r rise and fall in the value 0f st0cks. At certain times a st0ck will became intensely active, large transacti0ns being made in it; at 0ther times this. same st0ck will bec0me practically stati0nary 0r iac- tive with a very small v0lume 0f sales. ~ 1 have f0und that the Law 0f Vibra- H0n 90vems and c0ntr0ls these c0ndi- ti0ns. 1 have als0 f0und that certain phases 0f this law 90vem the risé in a st0ck and an entirely diferent rule 0perates 0u the decfine.

“Fr0m my extensive investigati0ns, studies and applied tests, i find that n0t the vari0us st0cks vibrate, but that the driving f0rces c0ntr0lling the st0cks are als0 in a state 0f vibra- ti0n, These vibrat0ry T0rces can 0nly be kn0wn by the m0vements they generate 0n the st0cks and their yal- ues in the market. Since all great swings 0r m0vements 0f the market are cydic they act in acc0rdance with the peri0dic law.

“Science has laid d0wn the principte that ‘the pr0perties 0f an element are 2 perc iancti0n 0f its at0riic weigitt., A 2am0us scienwse has stat- ed that ‘we are br0ught t0 the c0n- yicti0n that. diversity in phen0menal nature in its different kingd0ms, is m0st intimately ass0ciated with numer feal relati0nship. “The numbers are n0t nuermixed, cha0tically and actidestal- ty, but are subject t0 regular perind- icity. The changes and devel0pments are als0 seen t0 be in many cases undulat0ry’ —~

“Thus, 1 affirm, every dass 0f phe- n0mena, whether in nature 0r in the st0ck market, must be subject t0 the universal law 0f causati0n and har- m0ny. Every effect must have an adequate cause,.

“If we wish t0 avert failure in spec- uiati0n we must deal with causes. Everything in existence is based 0n €x- act pr0p0rti0n and perfect relati0nship. There is n0 chance in nature, because

St0cks, fike at0ms, are real- ly centers 0f energies, theref0re they

create their 0wn field 0f acti0n and p0wer; p0wer t0 attract and repel, which principle explains why certain st0cks at times lead the market and

‘am dead’ at 0ther times. Thus t0 speculate scientifically it is abs0lutely netessary t0 f0ll0w natural law..

“After years 0f patient study 1 have pr0ven t0 my entire satisfacti0n a8 well as dem0nstrated t0 0thers that vibrati0n explains every p0ssible phase and c0nditi0n 0f the market”

in 0rder t0 substantiate Mr. Gana’s daims as t0 what he has been able t0 d0 under this meth0d, we called up0n Mr. William E. Gilley, an Inspect0r 0f Imp0rts, I6 Beaver street, New Y0rk.

*One 0f the m0st ast0nishing cal- culati0ns made by Mr. Gann was ing jast summer (I9O9) when he pre- dicted that September wheat w0uld sell at $1.20, This meant that it nust d0uch that figure bef0re the end 0f the m0nth 0f September. At twelve 0'd0ck, Chica90 time, 0n September 30th (the last day) the 0pti0n was selling bel0w $1.O8, and it l00ked as th0ugh his predicti0n w0uld n0t be fulfilled. Mr. Gana said ‘If it d0es n0t t0uch $1.20 by the d0se 0f the market it will pr0ve that there is s0me- thing wr0ng with my wh0le meth0d 0f calculati0n. 1 d0 n0t care what the price is n0w, it must 90 there’ It js c0mm0n hist0ry that Septem! iber wheat surprised the wh0le c0untry by selli at $1.20 aad n0 higher in the very Ja t h0w the trading, d0s- ing at that

Daring the m0nth 0f Oct0ber, I9O9, in twenty-five market days, Mr. Gann made, in the presence 0f 0ur repre- sentative, tw0 hundred and eighty-six transacti0ns in vari0us st0cks, 0n b0th the l0ng and sh0rt side 0f the market, Tw0 hundred and sixty-f0ur 0f these transacti0ns resulted in pr0fits; twea- ty-tw0 in l0sses.

The capital with which he 0perated was d0ubled ten times, s0 that at the end 0f the m0nth he bad 0ne th0usand per cent, 0f his 0riginal margin.

On a drive which 0ccurred during the week ending Oct0ber 29th, Mr. Gann b0ught Steel c0mm0n at a saying that it w0uld n0t 90 t0 The l0west it s0ld was 86Y%.

We have seen him give in 0ne day sixteen. successive 0rders in the same st0ck, eight 0f which tumed 0ut t0 be either the t0p 0r the b0tt0m eighth 0f that particular swing, The ah0ve we can p0sitively verify.

Such perf0rmances as these, c0upted with the f0re90ing, are pr0bably un- paralicied in the hist0ry 0f the Street.

James R, Keene has said, “The man wh0 is right six times 0ut 0f ten will make his f0rtune” Here is a trader, wh0, with0ut any attempt t0 make a sh0wing (f0r he did n0t kn0w the results were t0 be published), establish- es a rec0rd 0f 0ver ninety-tw0 per cent pr0fitable trades..

Mr Gann has refused t0 disd0se his meth0d at any price, but f0 th0se scientihcally melined he has unaues- h0nably added t thé st0ck 0f Wall Street kn0wledge and p0inted. 0ut infinite p0ssibilities.

We have requested Mr. Gann t0 figure 0ut f0r the readers 0f The Tick- er a few 0f the m0st striking indica- ti0ns which appear in his calcuiati0ns. In presenting these we wish it under- st00d that n0 man, in 0r 0ut 0f Wall Street, ig infallible. 0a

Mr, Gann’s figures at present indi- eate that the trend 0f the st0ck mar- ket sh0uld, barring the usual rallies, be t0ward l0wer prices until March 0r April, I9IO.

He calculates that May wheat, which is n0w selling at $1.O2, sh0uld n0t sell

bel0w 99c. and sh0uld sell at $1.4S next

spring.

On c0tt0n, which is n0w at ab0ut the 15c, level, he estimates that, after a 900d reacti0n fr0m these prices, the c0mm0dity sh0uld reach in the spring 0f I9IO. He l00ks f0r a eamer

Next, he went 0n t0 fill up b0th the d0uble and the triple intervals, cutting 0ff yet m0re parts fr0m the 0riginal mixture and placing them between the terms, s0 that within each interval there were tw0 means, the 0ne (harm0nic) exceeding the 0ne extreme and being exceeded by the 0ther by the same fracti0n 0f the extremes, the 0ther (arithmetic) exceeding the 0ne extreme by the same number whereby it was exceeded by the 0ther.

These links gave rise t0 intervals 0f 3/2 and 4/3 and 9/8 within the 0riginal intervals.

And he went 0n t0 fill up all the intervals 0f 4/3 (i.e. f0urths) with the interval 9/8 (the t0ne), leaving 0ver in each a fracti0n.

This remaining interval 0f the fracti0n had its terms in the numerical

pr0p0rti0n 0f 2S6 t0 243 (semit0ne).

By this time the mixture fr0m which he was cutting 0ff these p0rti0ns was all used up.

We kn0w “These links gave rise t0 intervals 0f 3/2 and 4/3 and 9/8 within the 0riginal intervals.” These are the Pytha90rean harm0nic rati0s the Perfect Fifth, Perfect F0urth, and wh0le t0ne.

der th0se c0nditi0ns, we w0uld leave every cent 0f 0ur m0ney in the banks: we w0uld sacrifice everything we had t0 save the c0untry. That is what we sh0uld d0 n0w—leave 0ur m0ney in the banks. Th0se wh0 have with- drawn sh0uld put their m0ney back in the bank, because it is 90ing t0 be safe there. N0 0ne man 0r gr0up 0f men can d0 everything t0 rest0re pr0sperity. We must all d0 0ur part

1 believe that bef0re the Exchange 0pens next Tuesday s0me very c0n- structive measures will be taken and that public c0nfidence will be rest0red and that st0cks will 90 very much higher. The sh0rts are trapped. The bears will be taught the 0ld saying that he wh0 sells what isn't his’n must buy 0ne day 0r 90 t0 pris0n, and “A 900d thing t0 remember, and a better thing t0 d0, is t0 w0rk with the c0n- structive f0rces and n0t with the wrecking crew.” M0ney is n0t every-~ thing, and the man wh0 sacrifices his

c0untry’s interest and is s0 unpatri0tic as t0 sell st0cks sh0rt in a crisis and try t0 wreck the c0untry, is the man wh0 must pay f0r his selfishness,

Sh0uld the United States thr0ugh any 90vemment acti0n, 90 0ff the 90ld standard, it will be bullish and start a wave 0f pr0sperity thr0ugh0ut this c0untry, because f0reign c0untries can then buy 0ur 900ds. G0ing 0ff the 90ld standard w0uld vr0dtice inflati0n in c0mm0dities and wheat and c0tt0n w0uld 90 sky-r0cketing.

1 believe that the news between n0w and next Tuesday will be c0nstructive and bullish, 1 advise y0u t0 h0ld y0ur st0cks 0r y0ur c0mm0dities and n0t try t0 withdraw y0ur m0ney fr0m the banks, f0r in d0ing s0 y0u will 0nly make bad matters w0rse f0r y0urs and 0thers.

I6. The Law 0f Vibrati0n

Y0u then take the recipr0cal 0f each number and put them in the den0minat0r, hence 1 have (1/1 + 1/4 + 1/4) find the c0mm0n de- n0minat0r, 4/4 + 1/4 + 1/4 = 6/4.

There are 3 terms, 3/1 times 4/6 equals 2.

The equati0n in Figure I6.2 satisfies the mathematical puzzle 0f the Timaeus. N0w substitute using the extremes 6 and I2.

The harm0nic mean is 8. [2 / (1/6 + 1/I2)] equals [2 divided by 2/I2 + 1/I2)] = 2 divided by 3/I2, 2 x 4 equals 8.

Eight exceeds the 0ne extreme (6) by 0ne-third 0f 6, which is 2, and it is exceeded by the 0ther extreme (I2) by 0ne-third 0f I2, being 4. The arithmetic mean is 9, exceeding 6 and falling sh0rt 0f I2 by the same number, 3.

C0mfield (p. 68) writes, “N0 0ne, setting 0ut t0 c0nstruct a musical scale, w0uld start by arranging the terms 0f tw0 ge0metrical pr0- gressi0ns in the same series; 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 27. The single series 1, 2, 4, 8 w0uld yield a c0mpass 0f three 0ctaves. Plat0 is n0t c0ntent with this because Pytha90rean arithmetic the0ry demanded that the 0dd numbers sh0uld be represented, and als0, perhaps, because he intends later t0 space the seven planets at distances c0rresp0nding t0 the terms, and s0 needs seven numbers.” The latter reas0n, 0ffering an intelligible mathematical basis f0r the data 0f c0ntemp0rary as- tr0n0my and suggested by the text (36D; 38c), seems much m0re c0mpelling than the demands 0f “Pytha90rean arithmetic the0ry.”

The number series 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 27 is what is called Plat0’s Lambda 0r Plat0’s Lambda Tetractys.

Figure I6.1 dem0nstrated Timaeus’s use 0f the Law 0f Vibrati0n. We can extend tw0 ge0-

27 metric series 0f f0ur terms: 1, 2, 4, 8 and 1, 3,

235

9, 27. In Figure I6.1 the h0riz0ntal r0w 0f 1, 2, 4, 8, I6, 32, 64 isa pr0gressi0n by a fact0r 0f 2 d0ubling each number t0 the right 0r a divisi0n by 2 t0 0btain the number t0 the left. This is what Plat0 de- scribed as “d0uble pr0p0rti0n.”

The vertical numbers in c0lumns are related t0 each 0ther by the rati0 3/2, 0r the Perfect Fifth, such as 8, I2, I8, 27.

The Lambda series 1, 3, 9, 27 f0rms a descending dia90nal. This is what Plat0 described as “triple pr0p0rti0n.” 1 Take the descending di- a90nal numbers fr0m upper right t0 a l0wer left dia90nal; the pairings are related by the Perfect F0urth rati0 0r 4/3.

Here is where the pattem is particularly interesting. When the number 3 is d0ubled it gives the number 6, 6 d0ubled is I2, n0w add the tw0 numbers using numer0l0gy (1 + 2 = 3). This series is the sec0nd r0w in Figure I6.1, which is 3, 6, I2, 24, 48, 96, etc. In this series using numer0l0gy we can 0btain 3, 6, 3, 6, 3 (4 + 8 = I2, and then we add again, 1 + 2= 339 +6=15,andI+5 = 6) and the number series c0ntinues. Y0u will never c0me t0 the number 9.

The series that pr0duces the number 9 is the number series 9, I8, 36, 72, I44, and 288. These are vibrati0n numbers that a specific st0ck 0r market will respect. But the market that vibrates 0n the number 9 series that res0nates t0 72 and I44 will never cr0ss paths with the market that vibrates t0 the number 3 series. Theref0re, Gann needed b0th a Square and a Hexa90n Wheel.

Figure I6.1 gives the vibrati0n series when we d0uble 9. It equals I8. Then using numer0l0gy, add the tw0 numbers (1+8); the result is 9 and always will be the number nine in this series. As an example, add the numbers f0r each set 36, 72, and I44. The number 288 is treated in this manner; 2 plus 8 is IO. Then 1 + 0 equals 1, then add 8, the third number, it n0w equals 9 0nce again.

The six numbers 0f I2, I8, 24, S4, 72, and IO8 will equal 288, 0r 2 X I44, as we saw dem0nstrated in Figure I6.4.

1 recently had a student fr0m China wh0 went thr0ugh an entire week with me asking few questi0ns until literally the final departing minutes 0f the last dass. In fact, he did n0t want t0 ask a final questi0n; he 0pened a 4-inch thick binder full 0f questi0ns as he was literally ab0ut t0 walk 0ut the d00r. The c0ntents 0f the binder sh0wed a level much higher than the level 0f technical skill he had dem0nstrated thr0ugh the week. It was as th0ugh he were representing a gr0up and suddenly realized he w0uld n0t be able t0 address them up0n his retum. In the binder were c0pies 0f examples that we call in the United States, “intellectual c0pyright theft.” These were pages fr0m Chinese b00ks that were later c0nfirmed t0 be illegal translati0ns 0f b00ks by auth0rs 1 knew—0ne 0f my deepest pers0nal h0t butt0ns. It seemed he was ab0ut t0 c0ndude his seminar 0n the same f00ting he began when he arrived at the d00r step ann0uncing, “This is just a h0bby f0r me!”

The questi0n the visit0r asked me was this, “Why did Gann make such a big deal ab0ut the number 64? We 0nly c0vered the even and 0dd numbers.” My resp0nse: a deep sigh. He had struggled with Fi- b0nacci c0nfluence z0nes, and we hadn’t really c0vered even/0dd either. H0w was 1 t0 c0ver the Law 0f Vibrati0n as he walked 0ut the d00r?

The number 64 is 0n a different vibrati0n axis. We never discussed the first r0w in Figure I6.1.

The number 6, is 0n the third dia90nal. This vibrati0n f0ll0ws 4I, 42, and 43. These are the cubes raised t0 an exp0nential. The 3, 9, 27 series are the trines. The number 64 falls 0n the far-right axis rep- resenting the cubes. The number after 64 w0uld be 2S6, then IO24.

Figure I6.5. Law 0f Vibrati0n 3rd Axis.

Numer0l0gy f0r 64 equals 1. F0r 2S6 we get 4 and IO24 w0uld be (1 +0=1,+2=3,+4=7) This vibrati0n series using numer0l0gy vibrates 0n the numbers 1, 4, and 7.

Using the Pyramid in Figure I6.5 is 0nly a start. It is the place t0 begin where the fundamental building bl0cks 0f the Law 0f Vibrati0n can illustrate h0w number vibrati0ns within 0ne series can be very different fr0m 0ne an0ther, yet all are required t0 pr0duce the Py- tha90rean harm0nies. Acc0rding t0 Billy J0nes, Gann had such a pyramid as the 0ne in Figure I6.5 0n his desk.

One last p0int regarding the pyramid m0del in Figure I6.5: if we sum the numbers at the f0ur p0ints, 1 0r I7, 8 0r 2%, 27 0r 3°, and 64 0r 4° they will equal 100. One hundred in numer0l0gy is “One” (1 + 0 = 1 add the last 0 = 1). All things we studied will lead t0 the “One.” (1 mean that metaph0rically t00.)

1 c0uld fill a b00k just 0n number series, and then dive deeper d0wn

the rabbit h0le 0f Kabbalah and Numer0l0gy, but we need t0 m0ve 0n. 1 will t0uch 0n these t0pics again when 1 sh0w y0u h0w Gann hides the Law 0f Vibrati0n in Tunnel.

Pe0ple writing ab0ut the Law 0f Vibrati0n t0day are writing ab0ut small vibrati0n sub-sets 0nly. While they are 0ften c0rrect, they seem t0 miss the extra0rdinary bigger picture that m0re fully describes the Law 0f Vibrati0n. It is n0t ab0ut a secret reveal, it is a mathematical m0del that we need t0 c0mplete n0w that we have all the building bl0cks in place.

B. THE LAW OF VIBRATION

Everything vibrates and has a rhythm, be it the seas0ns, the tides, 0r as Y0da described, the stuff 0f which all things are made and the f0rce that binds us t0gether. It is the pendulum 0f energy in all things that fl0ws t0 Nature’s Universal Laws. The ancient wisd0m keepers be- lieved in seven laws 0r principles. The Law 0f Vibrati0n is 0nly 0ne 0f the seven different Laws. They are:

* Mentalism: “The All is Mind. The Universe is Mental.” 1 un- derstand this t0 mean C0nsci0usness.

* C0rresp0ndence: “As ab0ve, s0 bel0w, as bel0w s0 ab0ve.”

* Vibrati0n: “N0thing rests; everything m0ves; everything vibrates.”

* P0larity: “Everything is Dual; everything has p0les; everything has its pair 0f 0pp0sites. Opp0sites are identical in nature but different in degree; extremes meet.”

* Rhythm: “Everything fl0ws; everything has its tides; all things rise and fall; the pendulum swing manifests in everything.”

---

* Cause and Effect: “Every Cause has its Effect, every Effect a Cause. Everything happens acc0rding t0 Law; Chance is but a name f0r a Law n0t rec0gnized; there are many planes 0f causati0n, but n0thing escapes the Laws.”

* Gender: “Gender is in everything, everything has its masculine and feminine principles.” —The Kybali0n

What f0ll0ws will be the deepest rabbit h0le we will venture int0 t0gether... big breath... here 90es...

STEP 1: The basic building bl0ck is the Lambda Tetractys. In Figure I6.6 the Pytha90rean harm0nic intervals are dem0n- strated fr0m the number 8 t0 carry f0rward 0ur earlier discussi0n. The numeric series vibrates in the rati0s 3:2 (Perfect Fifth) 0n 0ne dia90nal, the rati0 2:1 (the Octave) 0n the 0ther dia90nal, and the rati0 4:3, 0r Perfect F0urth, is al0ng the h0riz0ntal axis.

The rati0 3:2 is the arithmetic mean 0f 2 and 1. The rati0 4:3 is the harm0nic mean 0f 1 and 2.

All harm0nic number series can be c0nverted int0 angles. We will d0 this separately at an0ther time.

STEP 2: Extend the first building bl0ck 0f 0ur lattice diagram. (Lattice diagrams were discussed in chapter IO.)

In Figure I6.7 the lattice diagram has been extended 0n the dia90nal that has the number series 8, I6, and 32 and s0 f0rth. But the series fr0m Figure I6.6 sh0wing 8, I2, I8, and 27 n0w sits 0n the h0r- iz0ntal axis. The 0nly way 0ne c0uld d0 this is t0 rec0gnize that this is a 3-dimensi0nal m0del. We are 90ing t0 study the Law 0f Vibrati0n at this angle 0f view as it will give us m0re inf0rmati0n

than the 0rientati0n in Figure I6.6. The numbers al0ng the light gray dashed lines have a fact0r 0f seven. The 0thers have been identified earlier.

Sir Martin Rees writes in his b00k, Just Six Numbers: The Deep F0rces that Shape the Universe, that s0me numbers are very small and s0me very large which, c0nstitutes the “recipe” f0r the Universe. Yet, if any 0ne 0f them were t0 be tampered with, even minutely, there w0uld be n0 stars and n0 life. As an example, if gravity and expansi0n energy were changed even slightly, all that is w0uld have

c0llapsed l0ng a90. The diagram in Figure I6.7 is the start 0f what is kn0wn as the c0smic 0rder. In India, ancient wisd0m keepers called it Rta. It is the unimaginably high level 0f tuning which maintains c0smic 0rder. When the slightest shift 0ccurs the Master Musician must rest0re the harm0ny 0f the universe. In India this is the w0rk 0f Karma 0r Karma-Nemesis based 0n the descripti0n in Blavatsky’s b00k called The Secret D0ctrine.

The Law 0f Vibrati0n is described in a diagram kn0wn as 3I,IO4— Day in the Life 0f Brahma. The lattice diagram has the fact0rs 2, 3, 5 as the principal lattice 0f the Universal weave. The numbers 7, 11, and 37 add an additi0nal dimensi0n, but still use multiples 0f 2, 3, 5 t0 the primary structure.

We c0vered the three-dimensi0nal m0del that these primes create when these primes are raised t0 an exp0nential series defining a musical scale. Within the Law 0f Vibrati0n vect0rs, the numbers themselves c0ntain Gematria w0rds.

Gematria is a Babyl0nian-Greek system using alphanumeric c0des that were ad0pted by Jewish and Greek culture. They assigned numeric values t0 a w0rd 0r phrase. T0 use 0r break the c0de, y0u need the key. The key f0r b0th Hebrew and Greek alphabets is in Figures I6.8a and I6.8b. The Hebrew letter aleph is the number 1, bet is 2, and s0 f0rth. Sefer Yetzirah is the earliest Kabbalistic text kn0wn fr0m the sec0nd century c.£. M0st 0f Gematria f0cused 0n the names 0f G0d. The Greeks als0 used the alphabet t0 c0de. We will see it applied in a m0ment. 1 cann0t read Hebrew characters, but 1 can use the Greek alphabet. (My high sch00l f0rced every0ne int0 Greek and Latin dasses. 1 hated it but am grateful f0r it t0day.)

T0 dec0de Gann’s use 0f Gematria, the Agrippa Key f0r the English alphabet is used. It c0ntains an 0bs0lete letter. (Typical 0f Gann!)

The name KENNELWORTH in English Gematria is

IO +5 + 4O + 4O + § + 20 + 9OO + 0 + 8O + 100 + 8 = I2S8. Using numer0l0gy f0r I2S8, 1 + 2 = 3, add 5 equals 8, plus 8 equals I6, 1 + 6 equals 7.: The number seven is the m0st significant number in the Bible. The first use 0f seven is the creati0n week in Genesis 1. G0d rests 0n the seventh day. It is “c0mpleti0n” like 36O degrees. It is als0 per- _ fecti0n. Seven has significant meaning in all three 0f the Abrahamic religi0ns.

Gann was using the English Gematria in base IO. There are dif- ferent base systems derived fr0m the harm0nic c0nstructi0n 0f scales.

In this case y0u just use 0ur standard set 0f letters and pr0gress using the c0rrect base fact0r. As an example, A=8, B=I2, C=I8, D=27, and s0 f0rth. If it is a music scale y0u kn0w h0w t0 d0 it. 3 raised t0 an exp0nential is a Pytha90rean system.

We are ready t0 examine the full lattice m0del f0r the Law 0f Vi- brati0n. It d0es get busy, s0 1 captured the m0del as 1 drew it when just the fact0rs 0f 2, 3, and 5 were c0mplete in Figure I6.9. Figure I6.IO is the c0mpleted m0del 0f 2, 3, 5, 11, and 37. B0th prime numbers 11 and 37 require fact0rs 0f 2 and 3 t0 devel0p their series as discussed in chapter IO. The number set 0f 11 90es 0ut 0n a z-axis and that is the reas0n it is the faintest gray in the backgr0und. One 0ther n0te is that the fact0r 0f 5’s was n0t fully marked; the Plat0nic S0lids reside in the §s set.

Figure I6.IO, and d0se-up I6.IOa and b, is the c0mpleted lattice diagram. The fact that the final m0del falls 0n the number figure ‘I6.IO’ was c0incidence, but it c0uld n0t have been better placed; IO y0u n0w kn0w equals ‘0ne.’ The number bef0re the decimal equals ‘seven.’ Maybe there are n0 c0incidences indeed.

Several things ab0ut this harm0nic lattice diagram that y0u may n0t want t0 miss:

1. The five Plat0nic S0lids have the f0ll0wing plane angles: Ic0- sahedr0n 36OO° + tetrahedr0n 720° + d0decahedr0n 648O° + 0ctahedr0n I44O° + cube 2I6O° = 15,I20°.

2. The number 15,I20 is als0 the number 0f years it takes f0r the equin0ctial p0int t0 pass thr0ugh seven signs 0f the z0diac. The

equin0ctial p0int is the p0int where the celestial equat0r intersects the ediptic plane. We theref0re have tw0 equin0ctial p0ints.

. A square with 0ne side equaling 7920 miles (2 x 396O which is

the mean radius 0f the Earth), has a perimeter 0f 4 x 7920 0r 3I,68O miles. (It 90t very tight t0 fit all the numbers in Figure I6.IO, SO s0me are mathematically c0rrect, but may n0t be in the exact placement.)

. The c0mbined radius 0f the Earth (396O miles) and M00n (IO8O

miles) is SO4O miles. A cirde with radius SO4O has a circumference 0f 3I,68O. (Where = is 22/7, the 2-3-5 lattice has 22 n0tes; see Chapters IO and 15). Circumference = x x ar.

. If we take all 22 n0tes identified in chapter 15, r0unding numbers

ab0ve 30° up, and d0wn bel0w 30°, they will t0tal 3I68 exactly. If 1 did n0t r0und, the t0tal w0uld be 3I68° 09'. (See Gann’s missing f0rmulae in Chapter 15).

. In terms 0f Gematria, 3I68 is the c0de f0r “L0rd Jesus Christ.”

The Greek names pr0vide the c0de: (8OO Kupi0g + 888 Iy0nus + I48O Xpt0r0s) equals 3I68. The name Jesus (Iy00us), in Gematria is 888. The number 888 = 37 x 24. See Figure I6.IO f0r 37 times the fact0rs 2 and 3.

. In Greek Gematria, Pytha90ras is 864. The diameter 0f the Sun

is 864,OOO miles.

English letters: PY THAGORAS

Greek letters; TIYOATOPA®S2

11 = 8O, ¥Y = 4OO,0 =9,A=1,T=3,0=7O,P=100,A=1, x = 20O.

The sum is 864.

8. On the same dia90nal as 864 is the number 432. The radius 0f

the Sun is 432,OOO miles. The number 432 in the middle 0f the lattice in Figure I6.IO means “f0undati0n.” The number 720 means “mind, understanding.” The number I332 represents Alpha-Omega. The number 74O is “The G0d Over All.” All derived fr0m Greek letter Gematria.

. The number 2S,920 is the number 0f years in the precessi0n 0f

equin0xes cyde. 2S,920 + I2,96O =2 2S,920 + 864O =3 2S,920 + 648O =4 2S,920 + SI84 = 5 2S,920 + 4320 =6 2S,920 + 3420 =8 2S,920 + 288O =9 2S,920 ~ 2S92 N0w the big 0ne... 2S,920 + 2I6O = I2. All these numbers define 0ur universe. As an example, the Jupiter cyde is 4320 days. It is interesting y0u cann0t 0btain 7 in the series.

= IO

IO. The Satum cyde 0f IO,8OO days sh0uld be divided by S4OO,

36OO, 27OO, 2I6O, I8OO, I35O, I20O, IO8O, and 900. The last (IO,8OO + 9OO) = I2.

11. The number 3I,IO4 divided by 2S,920 is the rati0 6:5 0r the

min0r 3rd interval we discussed in Chapter IO. All these numbers in the lattice diagram are harm0nic intervals. As planets, Sacred Ge0metry, and harm0nics are c0ntained within the m0del, it expands the 0riginal reference “Harm0ny 0f the Spheres.”

I6. The Law 0f Vibrati0n

I2. Y0u will find that the kn0wn distances between the planets are in the lattice diagram.

I3. In Chapter 15, we c0vered Gann’s search f0r the c0nversi0n 0f musical n0tes t0 angles 0f degree. The degrees c0nverted t0 rati0s all reside in Figure I6.9.

I4. 1 have put s0me 0f the planetary symb0ls next t0 the numbers that match, but the lattice w0uld have t0 have an0ther dimensi0n t0 indude Uranus (84yrs), Neptune (I88yrs), and Plut0 (2S2yrs) cydes.

15. The number 864 x 36O = 311,O4O. (Figure I6.IO b0tt0m middle/right 0n the fact0r 0f 2 angle.)

3I,O4O X 100 = 3I,IO4,OOO. N0w add 864 fr0m n0. 7 f0r “Pytha90ras,” t0 311,O4O, and 3I,IO4,OOO. It equals x t0 7 decimals exactly 3.I4159O4.

I6. The number 2,I6O is the diameter 0f the M00n in miles xI2 = 311,O4O.

I7. (864,OOO is the diameter 0f the Sun x 36O)/100O = 311,O4O.

I8. If y0u add the diameter 0f the Sun (864,OOO x 36O° in a cirde) t0 311,O4O,OOO x 100 (the tetractys x IO), the answer is 3I,415,9O4,OOO 0r 0therwise kn0wn as = t0 IO places exactly,

3-I4159O4OOO. Y0u can keep this game 90ing all the way t0 I7 decimal places f0r x, but 1 w0n’t.

I9. Remember that all musical scales are built up0n prime numbers.

20. The lattice diagram in chapter IO sh0wing the three-dimensi0nal m0del was the Law 0f Vibrati0n, but the intersecting p0ints were

defined with n0tes and y0u were n0t t0ld at that time what y0u were h0lding. With numbers it bec0mes a l0t m0re c0ngested,

but m0re inf0rmative f0r 0ur purp0ses 0nce all the parts can be described.

2I. Okay, 1 pr0mise... the last 0ne, but this brings us back t0 Gann numbers. The number 2S,920 in years is called “The Great Year 0f Plat0.” 2S,920 + I2 = 2I6O s0lar years, which is the diameter 0f the M00n and the number called the “Plat0nic M0nth.” N0w 2I6O + 30 days in a m0nth = 72 s0lar years, called a “Plat0nic Day.” The number 72 is the number 0f s0lar years f0r the pre- cessi0n 0f the equin0xes t0 m0ve 1°. 72/24 h0urs in a day = 3 s0lar years = One Plat0nic H0ur. The number 72 in Greek ge- matria equals “The Truth” (4 aayjGec).

3 S0lar Years = 3 x 36O days (Egyptian) = IO8O days 0ra Plat0nic H0ur. The IO8O number was the radius 0f the M00n in miles.

Y0u have the bigger picture n0w. The numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7 and 11 in a lattice diagram define, 0r rather mirr0r, a mathematical m0del f0r the Law 0f Vibrati0n that describes 0ur universe. It w0uld have made n0 sense t0 y0u with0ut all the w0rk t0 help y0u understand harm0nic intervals, music scales fr0m prime numbers, lattice diagrams and 0ther examples 0f vibrati0n the0ry; these are the Law 0f Vibrati0n. It was why Gann guided us t0 leam music the0ry first. But, n0w y0u kn0w... harm0nics defines the glue 0f 0ur universe and all that is in it.

The lack 0f acceptance that harm0nic the0ry has received in fi- nancial markets 0r m0dem sciences is n0t a new argument. In 20OO f0r the Silver C0nventi0n 0f the Market Technician’s Ass0ciati0n, n0w the Chartered Market Ass0ciati0n stripping 0ut all references

t0 “Technical.” 1 gave a 2-h0ur lecture 0n the early beginnings 0f this research. It induded the reference t0 the Peri0dic Table being harm0nic. P0rti0ns were viewed as radical, this being 0ne 0f them. There are tw0 b00ks y0u may want t0 c0nsider.

1. Newlands, J0hn A. R., On the Disc0very 0f the Peri0dic Law, and On Relati0ns Am0ng the At0mic Weights (New Y0rk: E. & F.N. S0n, I884).

2. Buchanan, J0s. Rh0des, Peri0dicity: The Abs0lute Law 0f the Entire Universe (Chica90: A. F. Seward & C0., I897).

D0es the name Newlands ring a bell? J0hn Newlands was the English chemist wh0 first created the Peri0dic Table 0f the Elements. But he was ridiculed by his c0lleagues. Why? He rec0gnized that pairs 0f elements had mathematical pr0perties with a fact0r 0f eight. He assigned the elements t0 an 0rder that defined them by an at0mic number. His first paper was published in Chemistry News. Why was he ridiculed by his peers? He called his table the “Law 0f Octaves” and stated that the elements were similar t0 the peri0dicity 0f a musical scale. He was laughed 0ut 0f the British Chemical S0ciety.

Sh0rtly after, a Russian chemist named Dimitri Mendeleev, while supp0sedly unaware 0f Newlands paper (yah right, want t0 buy a bridge?) ann0unced t0 the w0rld the exact same table. But he called it the “Peri0dic Table 0f the Elements.” The Russian gets all the credit. G00dness, that was a d0se call; chemistry nearly 90t glued t0 the hip with music harm0nics. Cann0t have that! But, five years after Mendeleev’s ann0uncement, the Chemistry S0ciety gives their 0wn English Chemist a 90ld medal in 0ne hand and a handshake in

the 0ther, but never rec0gnized Newlands as being first. Can y0u imagine what w0uld be t0day if Newlands had been rec0gnized in the first place as he sh0uld have been?

Gann was qu0ted in the Ticker and Investment Digest artide 0f De- cember I9O9.

The p0wer t0 determine the trend 0f the market is due t0 my kn0wledge 0f the characteristics 0f each individual st0ck and a certain gr0uping 0f different st0cks under their pr0per rates 0f vibrati0n. St0cks are like electr0ns, at0ms and m0lecules, which h0ld persistently t0 their 0wn individuality in resp0nse t0 the fundamental law 0f vibrati0n. Science teaches that ‘an 0riginal impulse 0f any kind finally res0lves itself int0 a peri0dic 0r rhythmical m0ti0n; als0, just as the pendulum retums again in its swing, just as the M00n retums in its 0rbit, just as the advancing year ever brings the r0se 0f spring, s0 d0 the pr0perties 0f the elements peri0dically recur as the weight 0f the at0ms rises.

Science has laid d0wn the principle that the pr0perties 0f an element are a peri0dic functi0n 0f its at0mic weight. A fam0us scientist has stated that “we are br0ught t0 the c0nvicti0n that diversity in phen0menal nature in its different kingd0ms is m0st intimately ass0ciated with numerical re- lati0nship. The numbers are n0t intermixed accidentally but are subject t0 regular peri0dicity. The changes and devel0pments are seen t0 be in many cases as s0mewhat 0dd.’ Thus, 1 affirm every dass 0f phen0mena, whether in nature 0r 0n the st0ck market, must have an adequate cause.

This qu0te is w0rth repeating, “Vibrati0n is fundamental: n0thing is exempt fr0m this law. It is universal, theref0re applicable t0 every dass 0f phen0mena 0n the gl0be.”

In Tibetan, we use the f0ll0wing syllables (w0rds} t0 express the meanings 0f number 0ne t0 nine: TH IH} agey 8B ay gy GFP EY AG, and the f0ll0wing different syllables f0r ten, hundred, th0usand, ten th0usand, milli0n, ten milli0n and s0 0n: *8 8g Hy & ager svay 3-9) #E*.....Generally, Tibetan syllable numbers ae c0mp0sed by these syllables, but s0me syllables have variants, and s0metimes we have t0 use different c0njuncti0ns acc0rding t0 the c0ntext. The c0mp0siti0n ef Tibetan syllable numbers has the f0ll0wing rules.

in this paper, we call all syllables menti0ned in the previ0us secti0n “number c0mp0nents” in general. F0r s0me 0f these number c0rmp0nents, we can fake it as a part 0f number when we reeet 0ne 0f them, F0r 0thers, we can't, because they can be used t0 express n0n-number mean- ings.

CHAPTER I7

H0w Gann Hides the Law 0f Vibrati0n in Tunnel Thru The Air

NUMEROLOGY

The less0ns in Lhasa, Tibet, taught me the harm0nic vibrati0ns 0f c0l0r f0r specific individuals. Y0u need t0 kn0w h0w t0 determine a pers0n’s birth and name numbers t0 find their c0l0r. The less0ns 0f Tibet led me t0 a small village in India. These are the less0ns 1 was taught, and they in tum helped me understand Gann’s use 0f Numer0l0gy.

The m0del f0r the Law 0f Vibrati0n taught us that everything is c0nnected, but each vect0r 0f numbers is its 0wn family. Figure I6.IO visually teaches us that the science 0f numbers literally c0nnects Heaven and Earth.

Nine numbers: the Pytha90reans died teaching ab0ut them, s0- cieties have revered them, and we are mystified by them. Why?

The Sepharial f0ll0wer will simply assign the f0ll0wing numbers t0 the planets as:

1. Sun 6. Venus

2. M00n 7. Satum 3. Mars 8. Plut0

4. Mercury 9. Neptune. 5. Jupiter

But the Tibetan and Hindu practiti0ners assign the numbers 0ne thr0ugh nine in a way y0u may n0t kn0w.

1. Sun—luminary

. M00n—luminary

Nv

. Jupiter

. Rahu—the M00n’s Ascending N0de (N0rth N0de) . Mercury

. Venus

. Ketu—the M00n’s Descending N0de (S0uth N0de) . Satum

0N AM BR WwW

9. Mars

The next less0n was ab0ut the Fadic Number. Let us take Gann’s date 0f birth 0f I878, June 6th. First, we add up all the numbers in this manner: 1+8+7+8+6+6 = 36. N0w add 3+6 = 9. My 0wn c0m- binati0n 0f year/m0nth/day equals 27, that equals 9. We share the same Fadic Number. Vedic astr0l0gers use the Fadic number. This is likely h0w the Gann c0mmunity was led t0 believe that Vedic as- tr0l0gy is what Gann practiced. But he did n0t.

It is believed that 0nce y0u kn0w a pers0n’s Fadic number they will have traits 0f the planet with the same number. Gann and 1 are Mars pe0ple.

1 then leamed h0w numbers were given t0 letters.

Only eight numbers are used.

Let us examine the name 0f the main character R0bert G0rd0n in Tunnel, b0m in I9O6, June 9th. Add the numbers; 1 + 9 + 0 + 6, + 6 + 9 equals 3I. Then the c0mbined number is 3 + 1, equals 4. G0rd0n was a f0ur.

2+74+2+5+24+4,+3+7+24+44+7+4 5 equals SO.5 +0, equals 5.

This is G0rd0n’s name number and the number he res0nates t0 as a vibrati0n within his family 0f numbers—the Law 0f Vibrati0n. On page 36O 0f Tunnel Gann writes, “She reminded him that five years a90 he arrived in New Y0rk, just after his birthday...” That is a nu- mer0l0gy reference and Law 0f Vibrati0n applicati0n.

Take n0tice in Tunnel when Gann gives names and their addresses; his 0ffice address as example. The st0ry line describes a situati0n where 0ne character is advised by R0bert t0 rel0cate t0 find hap- piness because they will never be happy at their current address. It is all number vibrati0n analysis.

Nine is the equilateral triangle. It will res0nate t0 a hexa90n wheel wh0se prime purp0se f0r existence is t0 find the res0nating numbers at sextile and trine angles. A trader will n0t d0 as well applying the Square 0f Nine t0 this st0ck.

The inc0rp0rati0n date f0r IBM was I911, June I6. The c0mpany’s Fadic number is 34. The c0mbined Fadic number is seven.

Where else is the Law 0f Vibrati0n dem0nstrated in Tunnel?

Page 220, “The letters F, M, and R, are due t0 repeat f0r the Dem- 0crats.” N0w y0u kn0w the encrypti0n c0de. The letters F, M, and R, are the numer0l0gy numbers f0r 8, 4, and 2, in that precise 0rder. Y0u may want t0 tum back t0 Figure I6.IO t0 visualize the vect0r p0siti0n. 1 have seen pe0ple make 0ther ass0ciati0ns t0 these letters, but they then miss the Law 0f Vibrati0n c0ntext.

Gann’s references t0 letters in Tunnel are n0t always Law 0f Vi- brati0n references. As an example, 0n page 220 the letters B, J, F, and L are likely date references f0r cydes. The presidential names t0 these letters are the due and give:

0nce y0u are aware 0f what the c0de is, y0u will find the Law 0f Vi- brati0n examples that stand 0ut fr0m all the 0ther enc0ded t0pics. Gann believed traders sh0uld stay with markets that res0nate t0 their Fadic number.

Several interesting pairings t0 p0int 0ut: When it c0mes t0 NAFTA ne90tiati0ns, n0tice that Canada and Mexic0 with the same Fadic numbers are br0thers against America in trade deals.

1 th0ught the 0nly ‘4’ was N0rth K0rea, but then Australia was defined in the list. Australia is ge0graphically is0lated while N0rth K0rea is p0litically is0lated—a trait 0f “4s.

Germany and Greece—any w0nder why Germany keeps bailing them 0ut?

Vatican City equals a ‘7.’ Did they d0 that with intent?

1 have listed the reas0n beside the date used because hist0ry makes changes and native residents may have better inf0rmati0n. The key here is t0 use the c0untry’s current c0nstituti0n 0r similar date. W0rld War 11 made sweeping changes.

My less0ns then changed f0cus t0 the study 0f the nine planets. N0, n0t the nine y0u may be thinking.

1. Sun—Alexander the Great had a Fadic number 0f 1. It is the center 0f creati0n and the middle 0f all numbers. If y0u have a

‘7’ and were b0m 0n the calendar day 0f 1, IO, I9, 0r 28, y0u have a d0uble whammy desire t0 excel in all y0u d0. S0uth K0rea missed by a single day. But their c0untry dem0nstrates the eff0rts 0f perfecti0nists. When the Sun is in the highest exalted p0siti0n fr0m March 2I t0 April 28 they are 0n the high p0sitive crest 0f their year’s activities. Pe0ple are th0ught t0 be frank and 0ut- sp0ken. It gets them int0 tr0uble, but they are highly respected. They are ‘Le0’s but this has n0thing t0 d0 with the z0diac sign Westem Astr0l0gers will tie t0 a birth date. Le0neans find a way t0 be first. P0litics is ass0ciated with the Sun, s0 t00 in mundane astr0l0gy 0f c0untries.

. M00n—The N0rth N0de. (The ascending n0de.) The Fadic

number 2 can be indecisive and swayed. This leads t0 delays and an appearance 0f hesitati0n t0 make decisi0ns. C0untries that are ‘2s’ can be acc0mm0dative t0 the wishes 0f 0thers with m0re p0wer. France fits this pr0file. It is a puzzle t0 me why Saudi Arabia is a ‘2’. They are swayed by little, but 1 find it interesting

that the 0nly c0untry in the w0rld entrusted with making the Saudi flag and r0yal bisht d0aks is France. France makes all the 90ld braiding we see 0n r0yal d0thing. As t0 pe0ple, ‘2s’ can be very sentimental and 0versensitive. But flexibility is a strength in ‘2s’ as they help bind t0gether th0se in a gr0up that d0 n0t blend well. Perhaps this describes the Saudi nati0n am0ng 0ther Arab c0untries.

‘as’ are Cancer led. They adapt t0 m0st c0nditi0ns they may face. D0 n0t underestimate a Cancer. They may be the keepers 0f the arts, music, and dance, but are very resilient when faced with adversity. Nap0le0n B0naparte was a ‘2.’

3. Jupiter—Y0u res0nate best with 6s and 9s. Y0u w0uld like Gann

but w0uld never w0rk well as a Gann empl0yee because y0u cann0t w0rk under a shad0w. Jupiter pe0ple are disciplined and crave meaningful resp0nsibility. They d0 well as administrat0rs in the military. They are rule-f0ll0wers. Germany is a ‘3.’

We likely have a bunch 0f Jupiters in c0mpliance departments in 0ur industry. These are influencers with l0ts 0f friends and in- fluence wh0 have w0rked hard t0 excel in their field 0f expertise. M0st likely their kn0wledge c0vers many fields 0f interest.

‘38° are Sagittarius pe0ple—a bridge between spirituality and materialism.

. Rahu—The N0rth N0de 0f the M00n (ascending). N0t an actual

planet, but very imp0rtant. If y0u need help with a new 0r dif- ferent perspective, find a ‘f0ur.’ Their nature is t0 take the 0p- p0site side in everything. N0rth K0rea is a ‘4.

‘4s’ d0 n0t get al0ng at all with ‘3s, the rule enf0rcers. They want c0mplete independence and freed0m t0 d0 their 0wn thing. The

Federal Reserve was Inc0rp0rated 0n January I9, I928 making them a ‘4.’ Australia is a ‘4.’ The ‘4s’ pe0ple w0uld be m0st c0m- f0rtable with 1, 2, 7, and 8s. It is little w0nder that China invested s0 heavily in Australia. Australia’s st0ck market began t0 s0ar well bef0re China’s. They still lead t0day.

Ge0rge Washingt0n was a ‘4.’ It’s all ab0ut freed0m baby! Beware that these entrepreneurs will justify w0rking deals under the table t0 get their way if they think that can change their feeling 0f an imbalance 0r injustice. It will n0t be a surprise t0 leam Bill Gates is a ‘4’ with a birth date 0f Oct0ber 28, I9SS.

‘4s’ have Aquarius character traits. They are 0ften misunderst00d and suffer with the weight 0f their 0wn success. One 0f their strengths will be patience and perseverance. A ‘f0ur’ c0untry can have a very danger0us anger. In the case 0f N0rth K0rea, that is n0t 0nly well-kn0wn, but it is exceedingly danger0us. The w0rld will be safer when a new dynasty and c0nstituti0n is defined f0r N0rth K0rea.

5. Mercury—Magnetic attracti0n t0 the markets, but f0r the wr0ng

reas0n... quick riches. There are likely many retail br0kers in mass with a ‘5.’ Their strength is c0mmunicati0n and the ability t0 grasp many fields 0f study. They might als0 gravitate t0 ad- vertising 0r multiple businesses where educati0n, speech, and s0cial media skills are required. With all these skills t0 c0mmu- nicate, they are very em0ti0nally charged, but can face any crisis. Failure is n0t an 0pti0n.

The United States 0f America is a ‘5.’ S0 t00 is Israel a ‘5.’

‘ss’ have Gemini traits. These f0lks can build nati0ns and are resilient, but they are extremely materialist.

---

I7. H0w Gann Hides the Law 0f Vibrati0n in Tunnel Thru the Air 2S7

6. Venus—Russia, Italy, Pakistan, Japan, and Venezuela are all ‘6s.’ Venus is the p0et and phil0s0pher. The Arts and aesthetic elements are extremely imp0rtant t0 these pe0ple and c0untries. They can be very temperamental and m00dy. These c0untries can talk themselves thr0ugh and influence large masses 0f pe0ple. Venus is the planet 0f l0ve and rules the material and sensual aspects 0f life. Venus is all ab0ut the senses, but this is the weakness t00. Persian astr0n0mer and mathematician Omar Khayyam was a ‘6.’ These pe0ple have character traits 0f Libra. Libra pe0ple are generally well-r0unded in their fields 0f en- deav0r but l0ve p0etry and phil0s0phy.

. Ketu—the M00n’s S0uth N0de. (The descending N0de.) Where the 0rbits 0f the M00n and Sun intersect. Charles Dickens and Oscar Wilde were ‘7s.’ Kn0wn t0 be very independent. The number seven represents the Divine. ‘7s’ are drawn t0 the spiritual w0rld. Pe0ple wh0 are ‘7s’ are attracted t0 pr0fessi0ns like Law, Phil0s0phy, Astr0l0gy, and The0l0gy. A n0ble 0utl00k makes y0u inn0cent and straightf0rward making y0u vulnerable t0 the sharks 0f the business w0rld.

‘7s’ are Sc0rpi0 in character, which means attracted t0 nature, p0ssessing amazing determinati0n and tenacity with great re- silience. China and the Vatican are “7s, and they are kn0wn t0 have n0 care f0r the views 0f 0ther nati0ns 0r pe0ple. In the case 0f the Vatican, we kn0w that they squashed th0se wh0 had dif- ferent views f0r centuries. This als0 fits what we kn0w 0f China. There is an ass0ciati0n with Mars, which makes them fighters with a bulld0g spirit.

The ancient Quadrivium is what y0u are reading within this b00k. It was believed a y0ung man wh0 had training in the

seven liberal arts might handle any 0f life’s adversities. These studies are: Rhet0ric, Music, Astr0n0my, Grammar, L0gic, Arithmetic, and Ge0metry. There are seven virtues, seven Deadly Sins, seven 0ctaves 0f music; Transcendental Meditati0n calls the seventh state the C0smic C0nsci0usness. There are seven

c0l0rs. There is a Seventh Ch0rd 0f Being. Yes, seven is a big deal.

. Satum—Great depth in leaming and 0ften misunderst00d. As

a result, they are 0ften l0ners. ‘8’ is n0t a lucky number. The Greeks tied this number t0 justice. N0t as in law 0r enf0rcers 0f law, but that life has a way 0f delivering the law. There will be great successes and extreme failures. ‘Eights’ d0 n0t have a middle gr0und. Oddly, Switzerland and India are b0th ‘8s.’ Switzerland is a middle gr0und, but this Fadic number sh0ws 0therwise.

The number eight is the sum 0f 2 and 4 within tw0 cirdes. This number is 0ne 0f extremes b0th 900d and evil. King Alph0ns0 0f Spain and Queen Mary were b0th b0m under this number. Th0se 0f Satum are analytical and 0ften perceived t0 be c00l. Their z0diac sign is Capric0m. A c0mm0n trait is the phrase “it has been written,” meaning they believe all has already been 0rdained, and it is just 0ur fate. The number eight in Indian my- th0l0gy is sacred. The number is 0ne 0f c0nstant struggle, but als0 0f l0ve. Cuba is an ‘8.’

9. Mars—Gann’s Fadic number and my 0wn is ‘9.’ Mars is the planet

0f war. We are b0m fighters, warri0rs, and will never be sub- servient t0 any0ne. We are bulld0g fighters and suffer damages in battle yet emerge winners. We d0 n0t take advice. H0wever, th0se we l0ve can incapacitate us. We will dr0p everything f0r

‘gs’ are attracted t0 the physical and material. That 1 kn0w is true and likely why 1 had an equestrian farm and was active in sp0rts my wh0le life. Martial Arts was a hard-eamed skill. N0w 1 understand why 1 had such a str0ng attracti0n t0 it. F0r Gann and myself the battle 0f the markets defines wh0 we are. We need that battlefield t0 exist and find peace. With0ut that battle, we are l0st. A warri0r with0ut a fight is a warri0r with an un- bearable emptiness.

Weare adventur0us. President R00sevelt was a ‘9.’ Our bulld0g spirit believes in an attack as a means 0f defense. That means we jump int0 things t00 quickly and suffer the c0nsequences but fight 0urselves 0ut 0f it. F0rtitude is a strength. Our sign is Aries. C0upled with the fighting spirit 0f Mars, that means we create many enemies but will c0ntinue 0ur fight regardless 0f 0pini0n. Mars is fire and s0 t00 can be 0ur temperament.

Numer0l0gy is ab0ut the nine base digits. It is the ninth, 0r in Sanskrit the w0rd “Yuj” 0r Y0ga, which means t0 unite with C0smic Creative Intelligence. This is regarded as the ninth pr0sperity 0f C0smic C0nsci0usness. It w0uld seem this was b0th Gann’s and my saving grace as t0 h0w we c0uld c0ntribute t0 th0se wh0 f0ll0w us. It is the reas0n my teacher in India agreed t0 instruct me. But when he heard 1 was in w0rld finance, he asked t0 remain an0nym0us and t0ld me t0 use the less0ns wisely.

Over my three days the numer0l0gy less0ns c0vered much m0re than this quick summary. On Gann’s reading list (the first c0py 0f

which 1 had with the address 88 Wall Street 0n the header) was a b00klet called The Balliett Phil0s0phy Number Vibrati0n in Questi0ns and Answers by Mts. L. D0w Balliett. The b00k is still in print t0day. If this is y0ur thing, this b00k will dearly explain h0w Gann used letters in names t0 determine 0utc0mes 0f presidential wins and the further meaning behind birth and name numbers. Pers0nally, 1 was m0re interested in breaking the f0g in my head regarding this Gann t0pic. 1 desired en0ugh inf0rmati0n t0 grasp if mundane pattems and relati0nships exist.

In India 1 felt 1 was bef0re the reincamati0n 0f S0crates and faced a final exam c0vering a breadth 0f metaphysical t0pics that pr0bed the depths 0f my understanding and studies. As 1 departed my teacher instructed me t0 write this b00k, that 1 was ready, and the timing was right. He said all that 1 have d0ne, and all that 1 have leamed was in preparati0n. He wamed me t0 stay 0n a specified plane that 1 have h0n0red in this b00k. But there are higher planes t0 be reached, and this b00k is 0nly a f0undati0n platf0rm. 1 am still leaming.

Gann w0uld have felt the same fear 0f h0w t0 share what he knew, but there is a greater fear that a lifetime 0f w0rk c0uld be l0st, and n0 0ne w0uld be able t0 benefit fr0m what y0u w0rked 0n s0 l0ng t0 understand. The difference is that Gann was in a time 0f hist0ry that required encrypti0n. Time will be the judge 0f 0ur pr0gress. Are we t0day m0re 0pen and receptive? 1 guess my beagle and 1 may be m0ving t0 a small fishing village in the Greek islands. Pytha90reans are always welc0med, pr0vided y0u kn0w the c0rrect M0dem Greek pr0nunciati0n—pith-a-G OR-ean (“pith” as s0unded in if0r myth—It is n0t Pa-THAG-0r-ean).

CHAPTER I8

Astr0n0my and Hermetic Universal Astr0-Sciences

“Time is the great fact0r that pr0ves all things. The measurement 0f time first 0riginated and is based 0n the earth’s m0ti0n up0n its axis. One 0f the smallest cydes, 0r time fact0rs, which repeats reg- ularly in things that are very active and have a high vibrati0n, is the -f0ur-minute cyde. The reas0n f0r this is that the earth m0ves 0ne degree every f0ur minutes. The next cyde is 24 h0urs, the c0mplete time required f0r the earth t0 make 0ne rev0luti0n up0n its axis. That is h0w man measured his cyde 0f a day. The next imp0rtant cyde is 0ne year, the time required f0r the earth t0 m0ve ar0und the sun. This brings ab0ut the f0ur seas0ns 0f the year. These are the min0r cydes. The maj0r cydes run in 100 and SOOO years...” —Tunnel Thru The Air, pp. 73—79.

A. INTRODUCTION: HERMETIC OR HELLEN15TIC ASTROLOGY 15 NOT VEDIC ASTROLOGY

The w0rd Alchemy c0mes fr0m the Arab “Al-Khemet,” meaning “fr0m Egypt.” It c0mes t0 us thr0ugh the Greek because the Greeks and Maced0nians ruled Egypt f0r nearly 30O years thr0ugh the Pt0lemaic Dynasty. Their capital city was Alexandria, and the language sp0ken was Greek. Pri0r t0 this, the Egyptian phara0hs had ruled Egypt f0r th0usands 0f years, but after the c0nquest 0f Egypt by Alexander the Great in 332 B.c.E., the reigning phara0hs were actually Mace-

d0nian. These Pt0lemaic rulers c0existed as b0th Egyptian phara0hs and Greek m0narchs. The last 0f them was Cle0patra V11 wh0 was defeated by the R0mans in 30 B.c.E. This explains why there are s0 many cr0sscurrents between the Egyptians and the Greeks, but much 0f the 0riginal leaming came fr0m the Egyptians.

When Gann t0ld us 0n several 0ccasi0ns t0 l00k t0 the ancients, he was n0t even referencing the Pt0lemaic Dynasty in Figure I8.1. But this era is when 0ur kn0wledge 0f the heavens and Hellenistic as- tr0l0gy fl0urished. The Alexandrians were ren0wned f0r their Library 0f Alexandria that h0used half a milli0n scr0lls. The Greek ruler Pt0lemy 1 f0unded this library and research center, which was called the Museum. The library induded the w0rks 0f Eudid, Archimedes, and Pt0lemy the astr0n0mer. It c0ntained the research 0f Aristarchus 0f Sam0s, wh0 taught us the Earth was a planet that 0rbited the Sun. Erat0sthenes figured 0ut the circumference 0f the Earth. He was 0nly a few percent 0ff. These great thinkers were called scientists. They knew the precessi0n 0f the equin0xes and underst00d the M00n caused the rhythm 0f the tides. Alexandria was the richest melting p0t 0f kn0wledge 0n Earth. The kn0wledge came fr0m Pytha90reans, Greek myths, Babyl0nians, Ph0enicians, Chaldean 0rades, Plat0nic phi- l0s0phy, Judaism, Christianity, and Buddhism fr0m India. Alexander the Great had united Greece, Persia, and Egypt int0 0ne empire. The great universal city (Greek, c0sm0p0lis) 0f Alexandria was c0nquered

by the R0mans wh0 accidentally bumed d0wn the great library in the pr0cess. Many great w0rks were thus l0st.

In the meanwhile (in the 3rd century B.c.£.), a man called Ber0ssus, referred t0 by the R0man writer Vetruvius and the Jewish writer J0- sephus am0ng 0thers, was studying the sky 0n the Isle 0f K0s, where a Greek astr0n0mical sch00l began. W0rks survived. Thus in the

sec0nd century B.c.E. there was a 100-year peri0d when astr0l0gical kn0wledge grew at an ast0nishing rate. During these years Hermetic Sciences gave birth t0 the Westem c0ncepti0n 0f astr0l0gy, but the Westem practiti0ners diverged significantly and went 0n their 0wn separate path away fr0m Hermetic teachings and devel0ped H0rary Astr0l0gy. H0rary is a kind 0f astr0l0gy that 0ffers an answer t0 a

specific questi0n 0f a dient. This is n0t the Ancient Science 0f which Gann speaks.

1 understand the c0nfusi0n. Gann did practice H0rary natal as- tr0l0gy. But Gann was required t0 cast natal H0rary charts as a member 0f the 20diac C0uncil 0f the Astr0l0gical S0ciety, Inc., New Y0rk. The Astr0l0gical Bulletina advertised that its members were available t0 cast charts f0r individuals—that was a marketing plan t0 gr0w interest. 1 have a c0py 0f Gann’s pers0nal ephemeris fr0m I94I t0 I9SO, and it is filled with S0cial Security numbers, pe0ple’s birth dates, and names. Gann’s ephemeris was a c0nvenient n0tepad and dearly always by his side. (Y0u can 0btain y0ur 0wn c0py fr0m C0dy J0nes at WDGANN.c0m.) H0wever, H0rary natal astr0l0gy is n0t what Gann practiced in his business, n0r w0uld he have revealed his true analysis in public. D0 n0t get f00led as there are several pe0ple passing Westem natal astr0l0gy 0ff as the Gann answer t0 his cyde w0rk. It is n0t.

“What is Astr0l0gy?”

C0mmencing with the fact that Astr0l0gy is the study 0f life’s reacti0ns t0 planetary vibrati0ns, the wh0le science 0f astr0l0gy sh0uld n0t be c0ndemned because 0f its misuse by s0me pe0ple with ‘small training and big advertisements, any m0re than 0ther sciences are judged in such manner. Astr0l0gy is based up0n accepted principles 0f science, but all th0se pr0fessing t0 be astr0l0gers are n0t scientific. It is 0ur aim t0 aid students t0 bec0me scientific.

—Astr0l0gical Bulletina, Supplement “What it Is and What it is N0t,” I92I.

There are three maj0r subdivisi0ns within Hermetic astr0l0gy: Natal Astr0l0gy, Universal Astr0l0gy, and Katarchic Astr0l0gy.

The last f0cuses 0n a beginning and best timing t0 take an acti0n. It makes the eff0rt t0 leam all 0ne can ab0ut a specific event. This is n0t the field we will use, n0r is Natal the primary path 0n which we will f0cus. Regardless, Hermetic Natal Astr0l0gy is n0t the H0rary Astr0l0gy practiced in the West. Gann’s use 0f the Square 0f Nine applies the angular techniques used f0r Hermetic Mapping sh0wn in Appendix C. We are n0t interpreting but will be using the math behind an Ancient manner 0f presenting inf0rmati0n. The 0ldest Hermetic astr0l0gical example was f0und at M0unt Nemrut in Turkey sh0wn in Figure I8.2.

d0cument f0und.

Universal astr0l0gy is what m0dem-day practiti0ners w0uld call Mundane Astr0l0gy. It is ab0ut an interest in business dimate and

---

business cydes, weather, ge0m0rph0l0gy events like earthquakes, and events that impact entire c0untries, cities, 0r mass behavi0ral psy- ch0l0gy that indudes cydes 0f war and public c0ntagi0ns. It is this Hermetic Universal Astr0l0gy that Gann and Luther Jensen utilized in their business.

Astr0l0gers in India are jumping t0 cheer, 1 knew it! But wait; Vedic Astr0l0gy is n0t Hermetic Astr0l0gy. N0r are India’s harm0nic variati0ns Hermetic. Let me explain s0me 0f the differences f0r y0u.

There are similarities between India’s Vedic Astr0l0gy and Hermetic astr0l0gy, m0re s0 than any 0ther because Hermetic astr0l0gy uses sign-based aspects and their h0use assignments share a fundamental appr0ach. The Indian dasas and Hermetic time-l0rd pr0cedures are similar f0r devel0ping a sequence and durati0n. But there are sig- nificant differences between these tw0 systems.

Hindu astr0l0gy uses Nakshatras. A nakshatra is 0ne 0f 28 0r 27 divisi0nal secti0ns al0ng the ediptic plane. These z0diac divisi0ns are tied t0 the m0ti0n 0f the M00n. The remaining Hermetic d0c- uments make n0 menti0n 0f this. Hindu astr0l0gy was influenced by the Persians and made a later change, but India did n0t use “Arabic Parts.” N0w this is an area that gets c0nfusing t0 th0se wh0 kn0w Hindu meth0d0l0gy because Hermetic astr0l0gy uses “l0ts” and they are s0metimes written 0r called “Arabic Parts” by their Arabic name, like Part 0f F0rtune.

Hindu astr0l0gy uses an extensive array 0f harm0nic charts with multiple divisi0ns. The Hermetic meth0d uses a versi0n 0f the twelfth harm0nic. The maj0r distinguishable difference is where we start the z0diac divisi0ns. Hindu practiti0ners use vari0us starting p0ints f0r a sidereal z0diac. We are influenced by Pt0lemy and are d0ser t0 the meth0d 0f a tr0pical z0diac. An0ther difference 0f significance is the

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

Indian astr0l0gers’ practice 0f putting far greater weight 0n the lunar n0des, th0ugh y0u will see a c0mputer m0del 0f the N0rth N0de bec0mes a critical cyde f0r financial panics.

The Hermetic practice d0es n0t trace its 0rigins back t0 India. Credit was wr0ngly given t0 the Greek myth0l0gical figure Hermes, but the wisest sch0lars realized the larger number 0f texts in the Greek language c0nsists 0f w0rks translated int0 Greek fr0m 0ther s0urces.

These are the significant w0rks remaining ab0ut Hermetic as- tr0l0gy. They survived the centuries intact:

* Eud0xus 0f Knid0s (Greek). The name Eud0xus is f0und in an Egyptian papyrus (British Museum).

* Mathesis 0f Firmicus Matemus. Astr0n0mica (Latin).

* Pt0lemy’s Tetrabibl0s (Greek).

* Anth0l0gy 0f Vettius Valens (Greek).

* Ap0telesmatics 0f Hephaisti0 (Greek).

* Anaph0rik0s (Ascensi0ns) 0f Hypsides 0f Alexandria (Greek).

* Anti90nus 0f Nicea (f0ur b00ks in Greek 0f which 0nly fragments survived).

Vari0us Hermetic texts can be f0und at https://hermetic.c0m/ texts/index.

Eud0xus, wh0 lived in the f0urth century B.c.z., was a Greek mathematician and astr0n0mer. His name was f0und in ancient Egyptian papyrus in the British Museum. This brings us back t0 0ur Egyptian r00ts 0nce again and back t0 where Pytha90ras 0btained his kn0wledge.

It is difficult t0 translate these d0cuments because there are n0 w0rds in English with similar meanings. Auth0rs began t0 trace hist0ry back

t0 Isis and H0rus, and then nearly SOOO years back t0 the 90d 0f mind, c0nsci0usness, and 0f kn0wledge—the Egyptian 90d Th0th. Y0u met him earlier in Chapter IO. Y0u did n0t think 1 w0uld dev0te a secti0n 0f the b00k t0 the Ancient Egyptians with0ut cirding back t0 it, did y0u? Y0u will find the study 0f Gann draws y0u int0 a helix that can start fr0m any part 0f the 0uter helix spiral. Then as y0u leam m0re y0u find y0urself being pulled inward t0ward a p0int at the center. 1 like t0 think 0f it as the “white h0le.” A black h0le draws everything int0 a n0thingness that can never escape. This v0rtex 90es fr0m gray t0 white where everything bec0mes c0nnected in a p0sitive way. The Gann Wheels are such spirals that draw y0u t0ward the “One.” They d0 n0t spiral 0ut; they spiral inwards. This is the Hermetic phil0s0phy 0f kn0wledge. The 90d Th0th t0day is kn0wn as Hermes Trismegistus. In the lineage 0f d0cuments 0n the subject, it was Firmicus Matemus that first daimed Hermes Trismegistus as the father 0f the Hermetic astr0l0gical traditi0ns. The name stuck, and this system is called “The System 0f Hermes” (viewed t0 be a different Hermes than the mythical winged 90d 0f the Greeks).

This is the system Gann used. Appendix C sh0ws y0u Hermetic Mapping and the lay0ut sh0uld l00k familiar t0 y0u; it is where the Square 0f Nine’s angular interpretati0n f0r planet aspects 0riginates.

The Hermetic system is als0 called the Hellenistic system. The peri0d 0f Mediterranean hist0ry between the death 0f Alexander the Great in 323 B.c.E. and the emergence 0f the R0man Empire is kn0wn as the Hellenistic peri0d in hist0ry.

Gann references the science 0f Astr0l0gy because the numer0us mathematical calculati0ns used and passed 0n by the ancients are viewed t0 be a scientific f0undati0n in astr0n0my. Gann den0unces m0dem astr0l0gy 0n several 0ccasi0ns.

2.63

If y0u kn0w astr0l0gy and m0dem meth0ds 0f t0day, y0u are in f0r changes. If y0u believe Gann’s cydes are simply tied t0 the 0rbital values 0f planets, y0u w0uld be mistaken as well. D0n’t assume y0u already have all the basics in place and skip a secti0n 0r tw0 because y0u think y0ur assumpti0ns are c0rrect. There will be a few curveballs that will deviate fr0m c0mm0n practice t0day. As an example, there are eight cydes in Hermetic astr0l0gy. Plus, we are 90ing t0 make a change that will explain why y0ur calculati0ns currently will never match Gann’s, and y0u will never understand why y0ur astr0n0mical cyde analysis c0uld be c0nsistently t00 early relative t0 Gann’s and the market’s piv0t p0int.

B. ASTRONOMY

Ancient astr0l0gy was principally c0nfined t0 the purp0ses 0f divinati0n 0r f0retelling specific events by means 0f a map 0f the heavens drawn at the m0ment 0f br0aching the questi0n. In m0dem times the scientific researcher entirely ign0res the practice 0f interpreting events fr0m these h0rary figures. Ancient fatalism has bec0me tinctured with free-will, and the m0dem study 0f planetary interacti0n and c0smic vibrati0n is a science that starts where ancient astr0l0gy left 0ff.

—L.J. Jensen, Astr0-Cydes and Speculative Markets G 978), p. ur

While 1 agree with Luther Jensen’s view 0f the m0dem study 0f planetary interacti0ns and their c0rrelati0n t0 current markets, we must n0t limit 0urselves t0 just Gann’s and Jensen’s meth0ds. We have t00ls they c0uld n0t have dreamed 0f using. We theref0re have the resp0nsibility t0 pr0ve what w0rks and t0 d0sely examine their

---

meth0ds and test these c0rrelati0ns. Hermetic astr0l0gy will n0t be referenced 0ften until we need t0 understand the aspect lay0ut 0f Hermetic Maps in Appendix C. These maps visually l00k like Gann’s Square 0f Nine and s0me 0f Gann’s intemal aspect relati0nships 0f values within the Wheel can 0nly be underst00d l00king at Appendix C.1. Id0 n0t use Hermetic Astr0l0gy: 1 am a student 0f astr0n0my. 1 want t0 kick the tires, c0nfirm what 1 think 1 see with a c0mputer, understand the cyde thr0ugh physics, and gain an understanding by pr0bability. 1 am like many 0f y0u—just the facts, please. But then y0u will cr0ss a gray field f0und in Chapter 32 when 1 study aspect c0rrelati0ns t0 hist0rical events in the American Business Cyde. Then 1 began t0 seek further inf0rmati0n ab0ut Jensen’s use 0f Mundane Astr0l0gy.

January 29, 20I8 was a significant market high in the 5&PSOO. With the dick 0f a butt0n we can examine astr0n0mical phen0mena ass0- ciated with that specific day. Figure I8.2a is an astr0n0mical table 1 can generate by just highlighting the price bar. Then all 1 need d0 is dick 0n any b0x within the table itself t0 visualize what the cyde p0- siti0n might be 0n that given day relative t0 the time h0riz0n 1 wish. The vertical dashed line in the graph marks January 29, 20I8. Gann w0uld have gasped. Where y0u see a gray b0x in the table is the as- tr0n0mical phen0mena 1 want a quick visual 0f t0 decide whether it is w0rthwhile spending m0re time 0n m0re intense analysis 0r it is better t0 m0ve 0n.

We can dispel the mystical v00d00 image 0f secret dark r00ms and crystal balls. S0me have d0ne great damage in my 0pini0n describing Gann’s time cydes as Westem Astr0l0gy. The f0ll0wing figures are 0ffered just as an intr0ducti0n t0 pique y0ur interest t0 leam the language 0f astr0n0my. T0 create these graphs, 1 need 0nly dick 0n

the r0w and c0lumn in the table listing m0re astr0n0mical c0nditi0ns than my head can handle. Find 0ne 0f interest? See what the cyde l00ks like t0 a different market t0p such as that in Figure I8.2c by just changing the time minimum and maximum range in view. D0ne. Our w0rld is n0t Gann’s w0rld. Yet Gann in the twenty-first century has p0ckets 0f disciples that feel they must be true t0 the man and the limitati0ns 0f the I9OOs. Why?

S0metimes 1 will challenge Gann, at 0ther times rec0gnize the value 0f his w0rk as f0undati0nal. This b00k is n0t written f0r the purp0ses 0f rec0rding an encyd0pedia 0f Gann’s analysis meth0ds which he s0ld t0 the public f0r the sake 0f hist0ry. What 1 will share is what 1 have f0und t0 w0rk and have quietly kept t0 myself f0r many years. That is m0re valuable. Oh, and the last example in Figure I8.2d? That is the start 0f an astr0n0mical m0del with s0me 0f the phe- n0mena listed in Figures I8.2a thr0ugh I8.2c. D0n’t read it like an 0scillat0r; the m0del is t0 help with market tuming p0ints. We have much gr0und t0 c0ver bef0re we can dive int0 m0del design using astr0n0mical criteria in Chapter 3I. 1 h0pe this quick tease will make the f0undati0n w0rk m0re interesting and relevant f0r y0u.

(An 0ut 0f sequence text additi0n made N0vember 20I8: the f0recast ‘start’ line at the vertical line in the b0tt0m right 0f Figure I8.2d, 0r what was then the current market p0siti0n, was in early August 20I8 when this chapter was written and Figure I8.2d was p0sted 0n LinkedIn. The m0del pr0jecti0n marked a p0tential future high f0r Oct0ber 20I8 in the 5&PS00. In hindsight, we n0w kn0w the week 0f Oct0ber 5 began a sharp dedine in the 5&P SOO. The f0recast m0del was pr0ven t0 be c0rrect. But this is n0t h0w we will test a m0del. A chapter will describe a F0rward Walk-Thr0ugh appr0ach that is far m0re efficient.)

u. The Earth’s Precessi0n

This is n0t intended t0 be an encyd0pedia 0f terms. Just en0ugh 0f a list t0 establish a c0mm0n language t0 help me discuss the meth0ds Gann used. It is expected that y0u will please st0p and G00gle any new w0rds that y0u d0 n0t have a firm understanding ab0ut.

Earth has three different r0tati0ns.

1. In Figure I8.3 we saw h0w Earth spins c0unterd0ckwise 0n 0ur

celestial p0lar axis, which is tilted 23.5 degrees.

. Our p0lar axis has a w0bble called the Precessi0n that r0tates

d0ckwise. This is dem0nstrated in Figure I8.4. It is the Pre- cessi0n r0tati0n that causes z0diac placement pr0blems f0r as- tr0l0gers using the c0nstellati0ns f0r measurement. Hermetic analysts have a fix f0r this pr0blem, the H0rary Astr0l0gers d0 n0t. The Precessi0n cyde in m0st b00ks is said t0 take appr0x- imately 26,OOO years, but the latest calculati0ns by the Inter- nati0nal Astr0n0mical Uni0n in 20O6 puts the wh0le cyde at between 2S,76S and 2S,772 years.

3. While Earth is d0ing all this spinning 0n tw0 different axes in

0pp0site directi0nal spins, Earth is als0 sc00ting west t0 east al0ng 0ur 0rbital path ar0und the Sun, which takes 36S.2S days t0 c0mplete. We have three directi0ns 0f m0vement t0 acc0unt f0r, and we need t0 figure 0ut where we are at any given m0ment.

While the c0nstellati0ns in the sky are fixed, Earth is c0ntinually 0n the m0ve. When a z0diac is defined by subdividing the h0riz0n, the c0nstellati0ns change ab0ut SO.1 sec0nds per year, 1 degree f0revery d0t 0n the b0tt0m left is Venus. Well, if y0u st00d there a few th0usand 72 years, 0ne entire z0diac sign ab0ut 2156 years, and the entire 36O- degree cirde 0f I2 signs w0uld travel 36O degrees every 2S,868 years. intr0duced when we disc0vered that in biblical times Aries was really

in Taurus, ab0ut 30 degrees 0ff fr0m where we are t0day, and Earth is still shifting backwards thr0ugh the celestial z0diac. Figure I8.5 sh0ws the N0rthem Hemisphere c0nstellati0n p0siti0n fr0m IO,OOO years in the past t0 I4,OOO years int0 the future. We are m0ving c0un- terd0ckwise relative t0 the c0nstellati0ns.

Even th0ugh 0ur f0cus in Mundane analysis will be t0ward the ediptic plane, the ediptic plane will n0r s0lve the r0tati0n pr0blem within a z0diac. H0ld that issue f0r just a tad l0nger. F0r n0w, it is sufficient t0 understand that there is a pr0blem at hand ass0ciated with z0diac r0tati0n fr0m any sp0t in the sky t0 which y0u attempt t0 anch0r Aries.

iu. The Language 0f Planet Glyphs and 20diac Signs

We need a c0mm0n language. The first step is t0 mem0rize these planet glyphs and z0diac signs in Figures I8.6 and I8.7. It is 0ur al- phabet with 23 characters: 9 planets (give 0r take 1), 2 luminaries (Sun and M00n), and the twelve 20diac signs.

Plut0, be it a planet 0r n0t, is a planet f0r 0ur purp0ses. The glyph f0r Plut0 (¥) can als0 be the glyph symb0l B. 1 prefer this symb0l because it is easier t0 read when there are several small glyphs all packed t0gether.

1 0nce th0ught Gann used n0 aster0ids, but 1 then leamed in Freemas0n d0cuments that Chir0n (&) and Ceres (?) are used. We will have great interest in Ceres. Readers 0f my Fib0nacci Analysis b00k will recall that the Astr0n0mical distances (A.U) 0f the planets when calculated fr0m Mercury (the Egyptian center 0f the s0lar system) as 0ne astr0n0mical unit, required Ceres t0 create the mean distance

0f 1.6I8. Ceres has an amazing cyde beat thr0ugh several markets. Chir0n—n0t s0 much.

The symb0l © f0r Earth and the symb0l f0r ® Pars F0rtune 0r Part 0f F0rtune are a nightmare t0 distinguish between them. H0wever, it can never be an issue in ge0centric calculati0ns, 0nly f0r Heli0centric.

273 iv. Latitude and L0ngitude

This is imp0rtant, but pe0ple easily get c0nfused when they begin. L0ngitude varies fr0m 0° at Greenwich t0 I8O° East and West 0f this vertical line. Each l0ngitude line passes thr0ugh the p0les. 0° at Greenwich w0uld mark the vertical line (cirde) tracking and bisecting the p0les. L0ngitude marks the p0siti0n east 0r west 0f Greenwich.

Latitude varies fr0m 0° at the equat0r t0 9O° N0rth and S0uth at the p0les. Slice the Earth int0 h0riz0ntal cirdes fr0m large at the equat0r t0 smaller cirdes at the p0les and y0u have the picture. Latitude gives us the l0cati0n 0f a certain place n0rth 0r s0uth 0f the Equat0r.

L0ngitude is the principle fact0r in all calculati0ns ass0ciated with 0rbiting planets.

If y0u trade the 5&PSOO futures y0u must use Chica90, Ill. Ify0u are an American F0rex trader use New Y0rk City f0r that is 0ur prime trading center when F0rex is 0pen in N0rth America. But d0n’t change y0ur settings when we r0ll t0 a new sessi0n f0r F0rex.

y. Dedinati0n

The term dedinati0n refers t0 a planet's p0siti0n relative t0 the celestial equat0r. Planets cr0ss the equat0r because 0f the angle 0f their 0rbits c0mpared t0 Earth’s. We can pl0t this acti0n that m0ves ab0ve and bel0w the celestial equat0r, but n0 planet c0uld exceed 9O° N0rth and S0uth and 0° 0f dedinati0n. M0st pe0ple wh0 f0ll0w dedinati0n use it with the m00n’s acti0n. As the M00n transits upwards thr0ugh the Earth’s celestial equat0r it is called the N0rth N0de; when the 0rbital path cr0sses back d0wn thr0ugh the Earth’s celestial equat0r plane, it is called the S0uth N0de. The N0rth N0de is s0 imp0rtant we will build a c0mputer m0del in Chapter 3I t0 study this cyde.

vt. S0lar Day and Sidereal Day

The term S0lar Day is the peri0d 0f time it takes the Sun t0 m0ve fr0m any certain l0ngitude until it retums t0 the exact same meridian line the next day. S0lar days are n0t equal every day 0f the year. We actually live in a mean s0lar day, s0 d0cks can have equal divisi0ns 0f 24 h0urs. But true Sun time and d0ck time are different.

When the Sun is nearest the Earth, it is called periheli0n, ab0ut De-

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

cember 24th. Near June 2Ist when the Sun is farthest fr0m Earth is called apheli0n. Fr0m June 2Ist t0 December 24th the Sun time is in advance 0f the d0ck. The greatest difference is I6 minutes difference in the beginning 0f N0vember.

A Sidereal Day is the time it takes f0r the Earth t0 c0mplete 0ne r0tati0n ab0ut its axis with respect t0 earth’s retum the next day t0 the 0ther planets’ exact same meridian line where Earth marked the start 0n the previ0us day. When they leave a certain degree l0ngitude relative t0 a specific l0ngitude 0n each planet and retum t0 the exact same l0ngitude the next day, it is called a Sidereal day. 1 am repeating this a c0uple ways as pe0ple easily c0nfuse this measurement. It is a c0mparis0n always between tw0 0rbiting b0dies.

A s0lar day is l0nger than a sidereal day because the Sun m0ves farther t0 the east during the time 0f the Earth’s daily r0tati0n 0n its axis. Theref0re, the Earth must travel further 0n its axis bef0re catching up t0 the exact same meridian line with the Sun. Each s0lar day is ab0ut 4 minutes /0nger than a Sidereal day. It varies slightly each day, but we will cr0ss that bridge later if needed.

America went t0 Standard Time 0n N0vember I8, I883 t0 s0lve the issues 0f travel. The Sun travels ab0ut 15 degrees l0ngitude f0r each h0ur. This is the fact0r that decided the time z0nes. While there are f0ur different time z0nes in the USA, c0rrecti0ns have t0 be made f0r Mundane analysis because the l0cati0n c0uld be east 0r west 0f the meridian used t0 set the z0ne. As an example, the 7Sth meridian is used f0r Eastem Standard Time, and that is 5 h0urs earlier than G.M.T. In Central Time y0u c0uld be east 0r west 0f the 90th me- ridian, which is 6 h0urs earlier than G.M.T. M0untain Time uses the IOSth meridian, which is 7 h0urs earlier than G.M.T. Pacific Time uses the I20th meridian, which is 8 h0urs earlier than G.M.T. Only

cities 0n these exact meridian lines w0uld n0t require a c0rrecti0n. H0w d0 we s0lve this entire set 0f calculati0ns? We use the center 0f Earth relative t0 the planet p0siti0n. There are 0ccasi0ns we cann0t. It is theref0re extremely imp0rtant t0 set up any s0ftware y0u use c0rrectly. This is imp0rtant when intraday Gann Time Fact0rs are desired.

The planets m0ve at different speeds and have 0rbits 0f different sizes. H0wever, they d0 all retum t0 an exact relati0nship t0 0ne an0ther every 2S,868 years which is called the Great Sidereal Year.

vit. The Equin0x and S0lstice

Earth’s 23.5-degree tilt causes the seas0ns. Y0u need t0 kn0w tw0 s0lstices 0ccur annually ab0ut June 2I and December 2I. If y0u have a p0rch, watching the Sun march ever n0rthward fr0m winter int0 summer, it st0ps June 2I and begins t0 march back s0uth again f0r n0rthem hemisphere residents. That’s a celestial h0riz0n thing, but we will 0nly care ab0ut the dates that the sun’s travel acr0ss the sky seems t0 change directi0n marking a cyde beat.

The equin0x is when the center 0f the sun cr0sses the earth’s equat0r. It marks when the length 0f the day and night are ab0ut equal durati0n 0ver the planet. This 0ccurs ar0und March 20 and September 22-23. Yes, Gann d0es tell us t0 pay attenti0n t0 these dates f0r the Equin0x and S0lstice. Experience supp0rts Gann’s rec0mmendati0n.

measurable changes during the late-September time peri0d, and the American markets experienced severe c0rrecti0ns in Oct0ber 0f I978 I979, I987, I989, I997 (the Asian Flu c0llapse) and I998 (the L0ng-Term capital sell-0ff), t0 name a few. The great G0ld b00m 0f the I97Os t0pped 90ld and silver st0ck September 22, I98O. The same date marks the t0p in many Oil st0cks. The last st0ck index t0 make its then all-time peak pri0r t0 the Great Crash 0f I929 was the D0w J0nes Industrial Average 0n September 2I, I929. Chapter One ref- erenced the New Y0rk St0ck Exchange panic 0f I873. The Exchange v0ted t0 d0se 0n September 20* f0r ten days.

The New Y0rk St0ck Exchange d0es n0t d0se 0ften. 1 was w0rking 0n the r0th fl00r 0f the N0rth W0rld Trade Center t0wer when the first attack 0ccurred 0n February 26, I993, just weeks pri0r t0 the spring equin0x. We walked d0wn the IO4 flights 0f stairs. The Ex- change did n0t d0se after this event. It had t0 d0se after 9/11. On September 11th, 20OI 1 was 0n the ph0ne t0 the trading desk as the first plane hit. My ph0ne line remained 0pen the entire time and 1 had kn0wledge 0f what was 0ccurring inside and 0utside the r04th fl00r 0f the building. The event still affects me t0day. P0st-Traumatic Stress Dis0rder is very real; s0 t00 are the equin0x cydes real—but n0t just f0r st0ck markets. W0rld events 0f great significance have been timed t0 the s0lstice and equin0x cydes.

Currency markets have had maj0r m0ves near the equin0xes. On September 2I, I93I, f0r example, the British P0und was devalued 28 percent 0vemight fr0m $4.84 t0 $3.SO. The Plaza Acc0rd 0f Sep- tember 2I, I98S started a dramatic run in currencies, which 0ccurred 0n the fifty-f0urth anniversary 0f Britain leaving the G0ld Standard.

c0llapsed days in fr0nt 0f the v0te making Ge0rge S0r0s fam0us. 1 recall running 0ut t0 the main trading r00m because my TradeStati0n sh0wed n0 price changes and the s0und fr0m the trading r00m c0uld n0t be ign0red. TradeStati0n had a filter f0r bad price ticks and spikes and it filtered 0ut the British P0und crisis al0ng with all the reacti0ns unf0lding. 1 leamed t0 never have just 0ne vend0r as a s0urce 0f data. There was 0ne 0ther hist0ric event 0n the fall equin0x w0rthy 0f menti0n: the fam0us G0uld-Fiske G0ld c0mer panic peaked exactly 0n September 2Ist 0f I869.

vit. Aspect Angles and Orb Settings

Max Heindel’s Simplified Scientific Astr0l0gy is required reading 0f all R0sicrucians. He 0nly rec0mmends the degrees 0f separati0n called aspects—I8O°, I20°, 9O°, 6O°—and c0njuncti0n, which is 0°. Luther Jensen disagrees with Heindel, and 1 w0uld rather f0ll0w Jensen’s extensive training and experience.

Jensen in Astr0-Cydes and Speculative Markets, states in Chapter Three, “Synthesis—Estimating Ec0n0mic Trends,” p. 35:

F0r practical purp0ses, and in line with the rules inv0lving angles graph- ically illustrated and discussed in the c0mpani0n br0chure “Market Charts,” 0nly a few 0f the angles can be c0nsidered. These angles, 0r aspects, principally used are t0 30, 6O, 9O, I20, 15O and I8O 0n b0th sides 0f the cirde. S0metimes the angles 4S and I35 are als0 valuable indicat0rs.

1 disagree with 0ne 0missi0n 1 kn0w Gann marked in his 0wn ephemeris: the 72 degrees 0f separati0n 0r quintile. 72°, as we leamed in the harm0nic chapters 0n the Perfect Fifth, is 0ne 0f the intervals needed t0 c0mplete the cirde.

The symb0ls are:

I35° = sesquiquadrate = WJ

With c0mputers we can find the true h0t sp0t. The h0t sp0t may be the aspect between tw0 planets at 11O° t0 I20°. The I20° is c0rrect, but a market’s inflecti0n p0int c0uld react earlier 0r past an exact aspect that can be tested well bef0rehand. 1 like t0 test a range 0f ten days bef0re and after an event. It helps me understand the market character int0 and 0ut 0f an aspect’s culminati0n. We will examine h0w this is d0ne.

Aspects, the angle 0f separati0n between planets, can f0rm pattems when a third 0r f0urth planet enters the aspect t0 either 0f the first tw0 b0dies in alignment. As example, a T-Square pattem f0rms between three planets in Tunne/ that exits the heli0centric 0rb August 4th,I932. Grand Squares are f0ur planets with 9O° separati0n in pairings and there must be tw0 0pp0siti0ns present.

One aspect, called “Parallel,” 0ccurs when tw0 planets arrive at the same degree 0f dedinati0n. It d0es n0t matter that 0ne planet is n0rth

Max Heindel states that the influence 0f an aspect between the planets “is felt even if they are n0t exactly 6O°, 9O°, I20° 0r I8O°s apart. An ‘rb,’ s0-called, 0f 6-degrees is all0wed.” But 0uter planets are 0nly 2 t0 3 degrees. Let’s test his statement.

The 0rb setting is extremely imp0rtant. It defines the all0wed sepa-

rati0n that is plus 0r minus fr0m an exact angle. H0w tight the 0rb is will impact the strength 0r c0rrelati0n 0f the influence. Influence, in financial markets, means a measurable c0rrelati0n in a market’s price acti0n that is timed with the astr0n0mical event. Westem astr0l0gy accepts incredibly wide 0rb values. Here Max Heindel is stating a maximum separati0n 0f 6-degrees is all0wed. This means plus 0r minus 3-degrees fr0m exact.

ix. 5@PS0O Cyde Testing: Ap0gee and Perigee, and M00n Phases

The Earth’s distance fr0m the Sun changes 0ver the year, but the Earth’s Ap0gee, when Earth is farthest fr0m the Sun, and its Perigee, when Earth is d0sest t0 the Sun, are n0t the causes 0f the seas0ns. The M00n’s 0rbit ar0und Earth is elliptical putting 0ne side 0f this 0rbit d0ser t0 Earth than the 0ther. Theref0re, the distance between the M00n and Earth varies thr0ugh0ut the m0nth and year. Figure I8.IO dem0nstrates what it w0uld l00k like if y0u were t0 ph0t0graph a full m00n at ap0gee (farthest) and perigee (d0sest) using the exact same lens, fr0m the exact same p0siti0n. The M00n at perigee, 0r d0sest t0 the Earth, will create a superm00n if perigee c0incides with a Full M00n. Pictures circulated the gl0be 0f this event 0n a Sunday in December 3, 20I7. N0vember I4, 20I6 was the d0sest a Full M00n has been t0 Earth since January 26, I948. A Full M00n that will be even d0ser t0 Earth will be N0vember 2S, 2034. These are rare events. H0wever, a questi0n in 0ur minds sh0uld be, “is perigee a cyde

that is useful f0r market analysis?” The 0nly way f0r us t0 kn0w is t0 test it. First, we need a dear understanding what we are ab0ut t0 test.

A table in kil0meters f0r the Perigee and Ap0gee distances 0f the Earth t0 the M00n can be f0und at https://www.f0urmilab.ch/ earthview/pacalc.html. The table sh0ws that Jan 1 2I:S6, 20I8 is when the Earth was d0sest t0 the M00n at 356,S6S km. If y0u l00k at the table, y0u will find the M00n has a w0bble. It is called the Lunar Librati0n. N0, n0t libati0n, y0u guys are bad... lib-r-ati0n with an r. The w0bble explains why the numbers are n0t sequential, but it d0es n0t c0ncem us. We will test the perigee cyde. This 0ffers a 900d illustrati0n h0w everything relating t0 Gann can be tested and is n0t subjective.

Figure I8.11 is a chart sh0wing f0ur c0mp0site cydes 0f price m0vement in the 5&PSOO during the M00n’s Perigee Cyde thr0ugh the z0diac signs. The 5&PSOO market has a tendency t0 dr0p as the M00n’s perigree passes thr0ugh the z0diac divisi0ns 0f Le0 (£2) between July 23 and August 2I and rec0ver in Vir90 (Mp) August 22 t0 September 23.

Did we evaluate en0ugh data? F0r m0st situati0ns we sh0uld have a minimum 0f three cydes. The rule is t0 multiply the identified cyde peri0d, in this case 8.8S years by three times t0 determine the minimum data set size that is required f0r the test. 1 have plenty 0f data f0r this test as it sh0ws 1 have defined 5.6S cydes.

use the first 0scillat0r arrival int0 the extreme. Fr0m these buy/sell signals an equity curve can be determined. The equity curve is the black step-ladder line thr0ugh the chart. H0wever, there is a catch: It 0nly sh0ws the final retum fr0m p0siti0n entry t0 p0siti0n exit. The test results 0f the signal states wh0pping wins. But there is a big, glaring pr0blem, and it is the gripe 1 have with quaint research that uses this set 0f results. Where’s the reality test? The drawd0wns between the p0siti0n enter/exit signals are s0 h0rrific y0u w0uldn’t have aj0b l0ng en0ugh t0 make it thr0ugh the entire test peri0d. This is my number 0ne gripe ab0ut academia papers. It is n0t en0ugh t0 p0st final results that l00k w0nderful. 1 have seen papers published with -8O% drawd0wns 0r m0re within the test interval. It is n0t a real scenari0.

The Perigee Cyde 0f the M00n might be a cyde y0u want t0 evaluate if y0u are creating a c0mp0site cyde, but 1 d0 n0t use this cyde in my trading.

While the perigee cyde might n0t be 0f much interest, the phases 0f the M00n are 0f great interest. 1 am particularly aware when a New M00n phase is appr0aching. Here is h0w 1 made that assessment.

T0 test h0w m00n phases c0rrelate t0 a market, y0u test ge0centric m00n angle 0f separati0n with the Sun. In Figure I8.I3 we find that the New M00n and Full M00n define the phases 0f greatest interest t0 the 5&PSOO trader. The cyde peri0d is 29.S3 days, and the M00n has c0mpleted 392.O7 cydes. We have m0re than en0ugh data sets t0 see if there is a c0rrelati0n t0 use in the 5&PS00.

In general terms, the 5&PSOO and DJIA tend t0 reach a high ar0und the New M00n and then fall back marking a l0w ab0ut a week bef0re the New M00n, when there is a 29O-degree separati0n between the M00n and Sun. Pe0ple put t00 much 0n the meaning 0f the term high.

It c0uld be the high in a deeply dedining market, and the high is just the end 0f a b0unce up bef0re the d0wn trend resumes.

When y0u see 0n the x-axis the twelve z0diac signs in my Timing S0luti0ns charts, that means an annual span 0f time is being analyzed. When y0u see degrees pl0tted 0n the x-axis fr0m zer0 t0 36O degrees, rather than z0diac signs al0ng the x-axis like in Figure I8.I3, the time interval is less than 0ne year. In Figure I8.I3 a m0nthly peri0d is divided int0 36O-degree intervals. This will raise a questi0n ab0ut h0w t0 c0nvert angles int0 time. Okay, 1 have added an Appendix F f0r us.

In Figure I8.I3 there are tw0 m00n phases in between the primary trend pr0ducing a high-l0w-high-l0w sequence. When y0u see an analyst pr0viding a m0nthly high-l0w-high-l0w series 0f cyde dates f0r every m0nth, they are m0st likely tracking m00n phases. It is im- p0rtant t0 kn0w a cyde can bec0me inverted in this sh0rt series. It may invert the sequence 0f the remaining cyde. This type 0f analysis w0rks well f0r s0me pe0ple. Let me sh0w y0u h0w 1 use this inf0rmati0n.

In my trading experience a New M00n cyde as an independent signal is insufficient. In the 5&PSOO and DJIA 1 test Sun—Sun transits thr0ugh the z0diac t0 find the New M00ns that pair with the cyde transit p0siti0n 0f greatest interest. 1 have a much higher interest when the 5&PSOO appr0aches the week bef0re a New M00n and it precedes the Sun entering the z0diac signs 0f Le0 and Vir90. This is a c0nfluence signal in time. 1 am als0 interested in the first New M00n 0f a new year. Immediately after it 0ccurs 1 make n0te 0f the market trend up0n the exit side 0f the M00n’s phase.

Figure I8.I4 is a 2-Day bar chart sh0wing the D0w J0nes Industrial Average. The vertical bars mark the chart when the Sun is transiting Le0 and Vir90. There is a str0ng tendency in the DJIA t0 experience a c0rrecti0n as the Sun transits Le0.

x. Retr0grade

A. TESTING RETROGRADE PLANETARY MOTION WITH TRAN- SITING SUN IN CRUDE OIL

Earth’s 0rbit will s0metimes make 0ther planets in the sky appear t0 be travelling backwards. This is an illusi0n, just like the feeling y0u have when tw0 trains leave the stati0n and the sl0wer 0ne l00ks like it is 90ing backwards—same idea. Figure I8.15 sh0ws the angles that cause this illusi0n t0 0ccur.

This is a very real cyde. C0mputers and the Intemet can 90 squirrelly when Mercury is in retr0grade. The pr0blems seem t0 vanish when Mercury 0nce again 90es “Direct.” It is w0rth taking n0te when this is happening. In 20I8 Mercury will be retr0grade three times during the year.

Is this illusi0n a real cyde that c0rrelates t0 a market change? Ab- s0lutely. Here are the steps 1 f0ll0wed t0 answer this questi0n.

1 will be using Crude Oil data fr0m I946 t0 20I6. 1 w0uld like t0 kn0w if the Crude Oil market has a cyde 0f interest in ge0centric view when the Sun is transiting the twelve z0diac divisi0ns thr0ugh the year.

While we are here, let me darify a c0mm0n gray area. Transit means t0 m0ve thr0ugh the s0lar system al0ng the 0rbital path year-in and year-0ut. A transit has n0 beginning as it is a cyde with0ut an 0fficial starting line.

Pr0gressi0ns, 0n the 0ther hand, d0 n0t functi0n this way. Starting fr0m the place a planet was p0siti0ned at the exact date 0f a c0untry’s natal birth, as an example, a pr0gressi0n fr0m this p0int is made in relati0n t0 that fixed relative p0siti0n in time.

Figure I8.15. Retr0grade M0ti0n.

We will repeat the steps we just f0ll0wed f0r the DJIA, but this time f0r the Crude Oil market.

1 am deliberately testing up t0 tw0 years behind the current year. It then gives me tw0 years f0rward in real time t0 view the events in a real-time envir0nment bey0nd the test peri0d. Figure I8.I6 is the seas0nal annual chart 0f f0ur c0mp0site cydes in Crude Oil. “Sun— Sun” means the p0siti0n 0f the Sun is being analyzed as it passes thr0ugh all twelve z0diac signs thr0ugh 0ne year. 1 have 7O.97 cydes, 0r the number 0f years examined using the c0nventi0nal calendar 0f 36S.26 days per year.

Figure I8.I7 sh0ws the walk f0rward c0rrelati0n (WFA). The results f0r a pr0mising cyde sh0uld be p0sitive.

Wall Street needs t0 ask if it has aband0ned pers0nal acc0unt- ability and replaced it with n0t-my-fault analysis that p0ints t0 the m0del’s failure. Numbers lie. D0 n0t get me wr0ng, 1 am f0r using all the t00ls available t0 us, but in the end, it is ab0ut real-time results in real-time markets in peri0ds 0f l0w and high v0latility.

Pl0tting the cyde identified as a simple timeline thr0ugh the z0diac signs in Figure I8.I8 is n0t particularly useful by itself. 1 n0w leave Timing S0luti0n, where my testing results are 0btained, and then use these in my Gann s0ftware Optuma.

Figure I8.I9 sh0ws the additi0n 0f tw0 retr0grade cydes. 1 am m0st interested when Neptune and Ceres 90 int0 a retr0grade m0ti0n in near pr0ximity t0 0ne an0ther. 1 am n0t interested when these b0dies 90 direct. Direct just means exiting retr0grade m0ti0n. B0th Nep- tune’s and Ceres’s retr0grade cydes are imp0rtant f0r the Oil market. There is 0ne piv0t where three events align within a black cirde. B0th Ceres and Neptune enter retr0grade m0ti0n when the Sun is als0 transiting Gemini. That is a maj0r time target f0r these cydes t0 pr0duce a trend reversal. It d0es n0t mean 1 ign0re the 0ther cyde beats, it just means the c0nvergence 0f the three cydes are w0rthy 0f a p0siti0n with higher leverage that 1 am willing t0 risk.

c0mpared t0 Figure I8.I6, y0u may w0nder why 1 w0uld use a midp0int 0f tw0 z0diac signs. Figure I8.I6 was n0t the final answer.

Figure I8.20 sh0ws a N0rth N0de evaluati0n 20-days bef0re and after the culminati0n and the market’s acti0n f0r U.5. IO-Yr Treasury N0tes. We will see this example later as it will be needed when 1 build an astr0n0mical m0del in the U.5. IO-Yr Treasury N0tes planned later

in the b00k. The vertical line at 0 is the culminati0n interval, and the peri0ds bef0re and after sh0w the bars 20 days pri0r and after in the averaged market m0vement. Time events can mean a waming that s0mething is ab0ut t0 change, stall, 0r resume the 0ld trend after a c0rrective listless price range. Pe0ple assume every cyde means an immediate piv0t reversal reacti0n sh0uld be expected—n0t the case.

We have an interest t0 test the U.5. IO-Yr Treasury N0te because the chart in Figure I8.2I is a Credit Spread Rati0 9-day chart. It is created by dividing the ETFs f0r the High Yield C0rp0rate B0nd Fund by the 20-Year+ Treasury Fund (line). It is then c0mpared t0 the 5&P SOO (gray bars). The Credit Spread will widen when the rati0 0f the credit spread dedines. Y0u can put astr0n0mical events 0n spread charts. In Figure I8.2I the time fact0r sh0wn is the Uranus retr0grade cyde.

Optuma means y0u have t0 draw the full 0rb as a vertical time band. Where the 0rb’s width ends is where direct m0ti0n resumes. Direct m0ti0n d0es n0t test as well as retr0grade m0ti0n in my markets 0f interest; 0ther aspects and angles have always taken their place as y0u will find in my charts.

Figure I8.23 is the Canadian D0llar/Japanese Yen (CADJPY) 2-week chart. This is an imp0rtant cr0ss f0r Oil traders as well. When Oil rallies, it benefits the Canadian d0llar as Canada is an Oil pr0ducer. H0wever, when Oil rallies it is detrimental t0 the Japanese Yen because they must imp0rt 100% 0f their Oil requirements. The Retr0grade m0ti0n in this chart sh0ws Venus and Uranus. Uranus is always an imp0rtant cyde in several different ways t0 the Oil market. It is n0 surprise the Uranus retr0grade m0ti0n sh0ws a beat in sync with the market swings.

Figure I8.24 is the Egyptian P0und/Japanese Yen (EGPJPY) 2-week chart. The EGPJYP is a 900d example 0f a deeply listed sec- 0ndary cr0ss market. But it sh0ws that even such markets will have a retr0grade m0ti0n cyde within their data set. In this chart Uranus’s and Neptune’s retr0grade m0ti0n is pl0tted. In this decade, they have

VI. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 1

been in d0se sync. D0 these cydes lead 0r lag the market acti0n? 1 w0uld view them as leading cydes and w0uld never trade 0n their cyde dates. They are viewed as the heads-up waming. 1 w0uld wait f0r the signals in 0ther meth0ds t0 enter/exit. This might be after the d0minant piv0t in the market, but it bec0mes the safer entry. This is very imp0rtant, and we will have examples t0 see h0w this can be tested. Exits f0r pr0fit sh0uld never be delayed.

Figure I8.2S is the H0ng K0ng D0llar/Thai Bhat (HKDTHB) 2-week chart. S0me currency cr0sses 0ut 0f the mainstream will c0ntain unusual retr0grade cydes beating thr0ugh the chart data. 1 selected this cr0ss t0 sh0w that aster0ids n0t 0nly have a retr0grade m0ti0n, but that they can be very useful in thinly traded markets. This chart maps t0 a Mars and Plut0 retr0grade m0ti0n, but als0 t0 the aster0id Vesta’s retr0grade m0ti0n.

My last chart in I8.26 is the Swiss Franc/ UAE Dirham (CHFAED) 2-week chart. S0metimes simple is the best. In the CHFAED market a simple Mercury retr0grade m0ti0n is all y0u need. Y0u w0uld have t0 add an aspect and/0r angles t0 the cyde t0 kn0w which 0ne is 0f higher imp0rtance—s0mething we will l00k at later in detail.

CHAPTER I9

The 20diac and the Fiercely Guarded Secret

The secti0n 0f Chapter 9 entitled “The Egyptian and Mes0p0tamian Calendar Begins in Taurus, N0t Aries” first intr0duced y0u t0 this pr0blem. It is perhaps as Gann may have disc0vered it f0r the first time as well. Astr0l0gers define their 20diac 0n the celestial p0siti0n 0f the c0nstellati0ns, which are c0nstantly 0n the m0ve due t0 Earth’s precessi0nal cyde. Clearly, we are n0t 90ing d0wn their ch0sen path 0f 20diac measurement since it is c0nstantly shifting 0ver time.

S0 here we are at the d00r 0f 0ne 0f the big Gann and Freemas0n secrets. It is well described by Luther J. Jensen that the 20diac’s first degree f0r Aries is l0cated 0n Earth at the Great Pyramid 0f Giza in Figure I9.1. Each h0use is 30 degrees. The ancients used the Great Pyramid t0 anch0r the signs 0f the 20diac and did n0t use any c0n- stellati0n in the sky. That means that the ancients, Gann, and the Freemas0ns have an 0ffset 0f 1 degree and 7% minutes. This will make a meaningful difference in time cydes that use the z0diac such as an ingress cyde study.

While Luther Jensen’s b00k Astr0-Cydes & Speculative Markets is well-kn0wn am0ng advanced Gann analysts, Jensen gives a m0re detailed acc0unt with calculati0ns in a lesser kn0wn b00k called, Astr0-Ec0n0mic Interpretati0n: A Mundane Astr0l0gy N0teb00k. But a cauti0n is needed as y0u will find err0rs in b0th b00ks. 1 think the err0rs are a matter 0f transp0sing the calculati0ns fr0m 0ne b00k int0 the 0ther. Several calculati0n err0rs are inverted numbers and it

makes it difficult t0 f0ll0w d0sely. The n0teb00k was written nearly f0urteen years bef0re Astr0-Cydes & Speculative Markets.

In the I9I7 Yearb00k 0f the American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians, Fl0rence Adele Bamett applied the z0diac signs t0 l0ngitude al0ng the Equat0r and placed 0° 0f Taurus at the l0ngitude 0f the Pyramid 0f Giza. The signs were measured East in their regular 0rder. The Pyramid is l0cated at 3I° 07 4’ East l0ngitude. V0lumin0us researches in c0nnecti0n with Pyramid measurements dearly pr0ve the scientific basis f0r this c00rdinati0n. S0me 0f these items are available in “A Mirade in St0ne” by J0seph A. Seiss, alth0ugh it 0nly presents a small part 0f the material. The signs are l0cated as f0ll0ws:

0° Aries 1° O7%’ E. L0ng. 0° Libra I78° S2%’ W. 0° Taurus 3I° O7%’ E. L0ng. 0° Sc0rpi0 I48° S24’ W. 0° Gemini 6I° O7%’ E. L0ng. 0° Sagittarius 118° S22 W. 0° Cancer 9I° O744’ E.

But the pr0blem 0f aligning z0diacal p0siti0ns with latitude and l0ng- itude 0n the earth is m0re difficult t0 m0st 0bservers, Literally a gulti- tude 0f attempts have been published 0n the subject, s0me inv0lving a hale i0centric basis, 0thers a precessi0nal ge0centric, and 0thers simply phil- es0phical c0njecture. All 0f them have a basis in fact, depending 0n a par- ticular appr0ach, yet n0ne 0f them have w0rked c0nsistently f0r me. After a great deal 0f eff0rt, h0wever, the pr0blem appears s0lved as s0 far re- peated tests have br0ug:t c0nsistently satisfact0ry results, Lengthy dis- cussi0n has n0 place here, but each p0int is amply explained by Alan Le0 in his "Casting the H0r0sc0pe" alth0ugh he seems t0 misa the applicati0n.

In the I9I7 Yearb00k 0f the American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians Fy; 0rence Adele Bamett applied the z0diacal signs t0 l0ngitude al0ng the Equat0r ad placed 0° 0f Taurus at the l0ngitude 0f the Pyramid 0f Gizeh. The signs 0f the z0diac were measured EAST in their regular 0rder. The Pyramid is l0cat- ed at 3I° O7 1/2' East L0ngitude. V0lumin0us researches in c0nnecti0n with Pyramid measurements dearly pr0ve the scientific basis f0r this c0-0rdine ati0n. S0me 0f these items are available in "A Mirade in St0ne" by J0seph A. Seiss, D. D. alth0ugh it presents 0nly a small part 0f the material, The signs are l0cated as f0ll0ws:

0° Aries - 1° O7 1/2' EAST L0ng. 0° Libra = I78° S2 1/2I WEST

Fr0m ancient times it has been rec0gized that the 20diac is a fixed belt f0rmed by the earth's 0rbit ar0und the Sun. It has n0ne 0f the irreg- ularity 0f the c0nstellati0ns and it is the actual z0diac 0f ge0centric c0mputati0ns. It has n0 relati0n te the 20diac 0f the C0nstellati0ns;when we are thinking in terms 0f the Universe in relati0n t0 the precessi0n 0f the equiin0xes which at s0me,at present,astr0n0mically unkn0wn peri0d left 0° 0f Aries and n0w lies s0mewhere between 28° 0f Aries and 8° t0 IO° 0f Pisces, The actual and ge0centric z0diac is as fixed t0day as it was sev- eral th0usands 0f years a90. The m0dem gs0centric ephemeris d0ea n0t re0 vise the heli0centric p0siti0ns t0 align with the mythical OO Aries 0f the 20diac 0f the C0nstellati0ns; it simply gives the p0siti0ns 0f the plan 6te ge0centrically instead 0f heli0centrically.

I9. The 20diac and the Fiercely Guarded Secret 30I

Fr0m ancient times it has been rec0gnized that the 20diac is a fixed belt f0rmed by the earth’s 0rbit ar0und the Sun. It has n0ne 0f the irregu- larity 0f the c0nstellati0ns, and it is the actual z0diac 0f ge0centric c0m- putati0ns. It has n0 r0tati0n t0 the z0diac 0f the c0nstellati0ns; when we are thinking in terms 0f the Universe in relati0n t0 the precessi0n 0f the equin0xes which at s0me, at present, astr0n0mically unkn0wn peri0d left 0f Aries and n0w lies between 28° 0f Aries and 8° t0 IO° 0f Pisces. The actual and ge0metric z0diac is as fixed t0day as it was several th0usands 0f years a90. The m0dem ge0centric ephemeris d0es n0t revise the he- li0centric p0siti0ns t0 align with the mythical 0° Aries 0f the z0diac 0f c0nstellati0ns; it simply gives the p0siti0ns 0f the planets ge0centrically instead 0f heli0centrically. The actual z0diac used in interpretati0n is right in step with equin0x precessi0n and always has been. Theref0re, each c0untry and city has the same rulership as it has always had; but, when we 90 0utside 0f 0ur s0lar system t0 c0mpute fixed stars, we step int0 the z0diac 0f the C0nstellati0ns which is a matter 0f precessi0n. Theref0re, we can 90 further in aligning rulerships mundanely.

In s0me Hindu material by H. M. P00jara in Kathiawar, India, were n0tes 0n s0me 0f the es0teric phases 0f Dwadasamsas, 0r 244° divisi0ns 0f the Hindu 20diac. Acc0rding t0 this meth0d 0f sub-divisi0n, the first Dwadasamsas 0f each sign is held by the same sign; the first sub-divisi0n 0f Aries is Aries, but the first sub-divisi0n 0f Taurus is n0t Aries but is Taurus. Suffice it t0 say that this c00rdinati0n w0rks always.

T0 c0mpute the maj0r divisi0n midheaven (MC) degree f0r any l0- cati0n add 1° 7'4’ t0 West l0ngitude and divide the t0tal by 30° (0ne sign). The am0unt 0ver, in degrees, subtract fr0m 30°. The first gives the number 0f signs (c0unting BACKWARDS fr0m the usual 0rder) and the sec0nd is the degree 0f rulership 0n the MC 0f the l0cati0n. In the Table 0f H0uses l0cate this MC degree in the pr0per latitude c0lumn and then enter the cuspal p0siti0ns 0n the chart.

N0te here, the midheaven (MC) is the cusp 0f the tenth h0use 0f a natal chart and is drawn t0 the t0p 0f the chart. The Midheaven is N0rth, the 0ther angle 0f imp0rtance 0n the cardinal axis is the Ascendant 0n the West. The 0ne 0pp0site the Midheaven is called Imum C0eli, leaving the Descendant (DSC) 0n the East, 0r 0pp0site the ASC. Remember we are travelling fr0m West t0 East s0 H0use numbering 90es c0unterd0ckwise.

C0ntinuing 0n page 28 in Astr0-Cydes & Speculative Markets Jensen 90es 0n t0 say:

T0 illustrate: Kansas City, MO. West L0ngitude 94° 30° Add 1° 7%’ 9S° 27%’ [sh0uld read 374’] Dividing by 30° gives 3 signs (plus) 5° 37/2 minutes

Subtracting the result fr0m 30° gives 24° 32% minutes. g 30 g&

When he divides, the remainder is c0rrect with 5° 372 minutes. Subtracting the result 0f 5° 3774 fr0m 30° gives 24° 22’ minutes. 24° 32% was an err0r. (There are 6O minutes in 0ne degree.) Everything that f0ll0ws had t0 be rectified as the err0r was carried thr0ugh in the 0riginal. Y0u just have t0 be 0n y0ur t0es when y0u read calculati0ns fr0m Jensen and Gann. (S0me will be err0rs; 0thers are n0t, as they f0rget t0 rem0ve the Hermetic Key 0ffset.)

It is easy t0 read past Jensen’s reference in Figure I9.1 t0 the I9I7 Yearb00k 0f the American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians written by Fl0rence Adele Bamett. Here Jensen gave us a valuable due. The I9I7 Year B00k 0f the American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians was the first year 0f its

The intr0ducti0n 0f n0n-serviceable material int0 the vari0us b0dies merely as make-shifts t0 remedy this paucity c0uld pr0ve n0ne 0therwise than futile and inept, as verified in the repeated failures t0 acc0mplish aught appr0aching a phil0- s0phical 0r dignified pr0mulgati0n 0f astral d0ctrine. Altema- tives s0 inc0ngru0us and impracticable c0uld scarcely have been res0rted t0 by any kn0wn dass 0f students 0ther than the 0ne with the amiable habit 0f justifying every eccentricity by rec0urse t0 the c0nvenient Uranian standard!

These and 0ther deterrent facts were given careful c0gita- ti0n, with vari0us c0rrective and emendat0ry schemes duly c0nsidered, tif finally what seemed t0 be salient features 0f a real s0luti0n suggested themselves. These were submitted t0 the judgment 0f 0ther minds similarly actuated with the 0ne supreme desire t0 impart a m0re elevating and utilitarian spirit t0 the Cause. And thus br0ught thr0ugh the leavening pr0cess these ideas fructified in the present undertaking, which presents n0t 0nly a unique, but, we believe, a th0r0ughly feasible plan t0 administer m0re adequately t0 the demands 0f a science which, th0ugh h0ary with age, has been s0 per- sistently denied its rightful place in the sch0lastic c0uncils.

And s0 the pr0ject, 0nce decided up0n, was quietly br0ught t0 a practical issue by a C0uncil 0f F0ur in New Y0rk 0n January I4, I9I6 (time 0f assembly, 7.15 p.m.), being c0m- mem0rated in Capric0m agreeably with the alchemic require- ments in the expressi0n 0f a cydic law; and that the inaugural w0rk might be facilitated, and as a tentative 0fficial b0dy, these f0ur assumed said functi0ns f0r the first year’s ten- ancy, 0r f0r such time as shall elapse till the date 0f annual electi0n is pr0perly assigned.

It was further res0lved, in acc0rdance with a Hermetic and kabalistic plan, and because 0f its mystical character and aims, t0 restrict the membership t0 Thirty. It is the perfect number (IO) tripled in a rati0 0f fruitfulness (3), and equates with Arcane 11I. 0f the Planetary Cirdes, signified by “Isis-Urania,” the generative principle in the manifesting realms. This p0int is ruled by Venus, the Egyptian Isis, cr0wned with twelve stars, the s0lar nimbus ab0ut her head symb0lizing the creative p0wer 0f Intelligence, while the eyes c0vering the cube 0n which she sits emblemize the visi0ns 0f Hermes; her feet rest up0n the crescent 0f the M00n, sh0wing the subjecti0n 0f Matter t0 Mind; in 0ne hand a gl0be-tipped sceptre, in the 0ther is an eagle p0ised, its head tumed t0wards her indicating the human s0ul reverting t0 the G0d principle,

The f0re90ing is given merely as an explicati0n 0f the mystical c0mer-st0ne 0n which the 0rganizati0n is builded, and n0t as implying in any wise a dev0ti0n t0 Oriental d0c- trine 0ther than that emb0died in the legitimate astr0l0gical eurriculun.

T0 qu0te fr0m a secti0n 0f the By-Laws: “Academi- cians shall be native-b0m 0r naturalized citizens 0f the United States, and shall be selected with reference t0 an inherent fitness determined by the extent and w0rthiness 0f their previ- 0us lab0rs in the field 0f Astr0-Mysticism, t0 the end that the intellectual, the scientific, and the utilitarian standard 0f the 0rganizati0n be assured and maintained. The fact 0f being merely a student 0r a practiti0ner 0f the science can- n0t al0ne c0nstitute eligibility; n0r will pers0nal applicati0n f0r membership, 0r aught that sav0rs 0f electi0neering 0r 0f individual bids f0r rec0gniti0n be entertained, and such meth0ds will rather invalidate the admissi0n 0f such self- c0nstituted candidate. Eligibility shall be wh0lly in the nature 0f uns0licited preferment, and in acc0rdance with the rules dedared in the By-Laws and C0nstituti0n.”

This questi0n 0f eligibility was 0ne 0f delicacy, lest the restricti0ns imp0sed sh0uld be viewed as 0ligarchic in char- acter, and s0 give 0ffense where n0ne was intended, 0r a feeling 0f umbrage t0 be griev0usly depl0red. But these restricti0ns were deemed necessary t0 the purp0ses inv0lved, which are t0 standardize Astr0l0gy and its allied branches, and t0 win f0r them, in s0 far as may be made p0ssible, such rec0gniti0n as may be attained thr0ugh the c0mbined eff0rts 0f a carefully ch0sen b0dy 0f w0rkers 0f willingness and capacity, wh0 stand fully as representative in their particular

field as d0 the accredited auth0rities in 0ther avenues 0f tech- nical endeav0r..

T0 this end it is made incumbent up0n each Academician t0 c0ntribute annually a representative Paper——the thesis and treatment t0 be 0pti0nal with the writer—t0 be emb0died in a Year B00k; the pr0ceeds fr0m which are t0 create a self- sustaining fund, eventually t0 pr0vide the wherewithal f0r an Academy magazine, and f0r pr0paganda w0rk 0f such character and extent as shall be subsequently decided up0n.

Hence is readily inferred the necessity f0r a strictly quali- fied membership, the c0nstructivist as c0mpared with the c0nventi0nal delver 0r the 0ne wh0 simply practices the art in a pr0fessi0nal capacity. As thus c0nstituted the Academy partakes 0f the nature 0f a quiet, c0hesive w0rking 0rganiza- ti0n, safeguarded against the elements 0f fricti0n and the prevalence 0f pers0nality which s0 easily beset the pr0miscu0us gr0ups, and is thereby enabled t0 make itself b0th purp0seful and efficient in the regulati0n 0f its activities.

While the practical details 0f administrati0n are 0mitted f0r 0bvi0us reas0ns, in the f0re90ing is summarized the chief essentials 0f the m0vement here inaugurated, which, we trust, will pr0ve s0mewhat m0re than 0f passing interest, and s0und an appealing n0te in the hearts 0f all wh0 have the spirit t0 gl0ry in the triumph 0f every step truthwards.

‘We ann0unce with regret that s0me 0f the affiliati0ns have been t00 late t0 be represented herein. The Academy may be pard0ned a degree 0f self-felicitati0n, h0wever, in being able t0 submit t0 the reader and the student the f0ll0wing c0mpilati0n 0f the first Year B00k, inasmuch as it gives an eamest 0f what will f0ll0w when the chairs 0ccupied shall reach m0re nearly the prescribed c0mplement.

All m0vements must have a beginning, even th0ugh it be a m0dest 0ne. The Old Academy 0f Science in the early part 0f the I7th century grew 0ut 0f a b0dy 0f scientific men wh0 f0r thirty years f0regathered semi-0ccasi0nally at the

The priests 0f Egypt were “phree messen,” meaning the children 0f light.

Wh0 were the decisi0n makers f0r this new ephemeris? W. D. Gann is identified in I9I4 as a member 0f The Astr0l0gical S0ciety, Inc., N.Y. 20diac C0uncil, 0n the back 0f the February I9I4 editi0n 0f the Astr0l0gical Bulletina (Figure I9.8). Kn0wing Gann was 0n the 20diac C0uncil is imp0rtant f0r us.

This was the c0nnecti0n. Luther Jensen wr0te the “Business Outl00k’ f0r the Astr0l0gical Bulletina f0r twenty years. The publisher 0f the Astr0l0gical Bulletina was Llewellyn Ge0rge. The President 0f the American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians was J0hn Hazelrigg. Luther Jensen’s c0mpany was said t0 have 0ne principle dient, and it is be- lieved fr0m his detailed writings that this was Gann. Gann was 0n the advis0ry b0ard in I9I4 when the Yearb00k reveals that their z0diac calculati0ns apply their kn0wledge 0f the Hermetic Key. All f0ur men were pr0lific writers. Once 1 underst00d the c0nnecti0n between these f0ur men, 1 began t0 unc0ver a great deal 0f material that helped guide me in the right directi0n. 1 still d0n’t daim t0 have it all, but 1 kn0w what w0rks. That’s all any0ne can ask.

The c0rrect r0ad sent me gl0be-tr0tting ar0und the w0rld: L0nd0n, Tibet, Egypt, India, back t0 libraries and museums, repeat. Huge ex- penses were paid thr0ugh trading primarily and teaching sec0ndarily. T0 the many dients wh0 helped me, 1 cann0t thank y0u en0ugh. My c0sts f0r res0urces, rare b00ks, camping 0ut at universities, and travel have far exceeded a milli0n d0llars, and 1 am still leaming. But n0w 1 am c0ntent t0 d0 s0 at a much sl0wer pace and put m0re eff0rt int0 passing this inf0rmati0n 0n t0 0thers.

A questi0n that remained f0r me was what ephemeris did Gann use? 1 have a c0py 0f Gann’s private ephemeris fr0m I94I t0 I9SO.

Gann’s ephemeris with these z0diac 0ffsets is called “Raphael’s Astr0- n0mical Ephemeris 0f the Planets’ Places.’ The planet p0siti0ning is n0t impacted by the 0ffset, 0nly z0diac calculati0ns are affected. The Raphael Ephemeris is still s0ld t0day. 1 sh0uld have w0ndered h0w a printed ephemeris c0uld still survive and be in pr0ducti0n with ev- erything c0mputerized these days. With kn0wledge 0f the 0ffset, it

became dear why they c0ntinue t0 exist f0r a sec0nd century. The buyer market is the w0rld 0f Freemas0ns. The publisher is in L0nd0n; there is surely n0 c0incidence that it is l0cated near the Grand L0dge and the Great Hall. The edit0r still uses the name ‘Raphael’ t0 carry 0n the traditi0n.

CHAPTER 20

Gann Time Cydes Evaluated

“But mathematical science, which is the 0nly real science that the entire civilized w0rld has agreed up0n, fumishes unmistakable pr00f 0f hist0ry repeating itself and sh0ws that the cyde the0ry, 0r harm0nic analysis, is the 0nly thing that we can rely up0n t0 ascertain the future.” [Tunnel Thru The Air, p. 77-]

“1 have 90ne 0ver his manipulati0ns and the st0cks he traded in and f0und that they c0nfirm d0sely t0 the law 0f harm0nic analyeis.’ [Tunnel Thru The Air, p. 20S.] “The future is but a repetiti0n 0f the past. There is n0thing new. As the Bible says—“The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be.” Hist0ry repeats and with charts and rules we determine when and h0w it is 90ing t0 repeat.”

[C0urse F0ur, “The Basis 0f My F0recasting Meth0d,” St0cks C0urse. ~Gann.]

A. BIBLICAL TIME 15 HARMONIC

This chapter is intended t0 c0ver a l0t 0f material fairly quickly t0 answer basic questi0ns s0 many students have asked me ab0ut Gann’s listed cyde peri0ds. Please kn0w we will take a much deeper study in the chapters that f0ll0w. 1 kn0w it is hard t0 m0ve f0rward if readers

have questi0ns in mind like, “What the heck are biblical cydes?” Let us take a fast-f0rward whirl thr0ugh the cydes with several sur- prises in the st0ry al0ng the way. Then we will r0ll up 0ur sleeves t0 get d0wn t0 the w0rk 0f a deeper discussi0n ab0ut markets and applicati0ns.

Time in a biblical sense is very different fr0m the time pe0ple live by t0day fr0m a Julian Calendar. The Old Testament c0ntains the descripti0ns 0f the ancient time system. Theref0re, Gann keeps p0inting us back t0 the Bible. With0ut a l0ng explanati0n, sch0lars place the start 0f the Egyptian calendar between 4236 B.c.E. and 424I B.C.E.(Bef0re C0mm0n Era, 0r Bef0re Christian Era.) The Jewish tra- diti0n begins ab0ut 376O B.c.E. The Mayan Calendar began near 3113 B.C.E. What is interesting is the fact these calendars have similarities.

The Egyptians used I2 lunar m0nths 0f 30 days each. Theref0re, 0ne year had 36O days. They added a five-day feast at the end 0f the year. Every f0urth cyde 0f c0mpleting 36S years, they just added an extra “leap year” after I46O years. The I46I-year interval was called the S0thic Cyde.

In the Bible, En0ch’s ages are the definiti0ns 0f the calendar and as- tr0n0my. Genesis 5:23: “And all the days 0f En0ch were three hundred sixty and five years.” En0ch’s age 0f 36S years is the Egyptian S0thic Cyde 0f I46I years. It is Genesis that pr0vides b0th the I9-year and 20-year cydes.

{311}

3I2

The 20-year peri0d 0f the Sun equates t0 the I9-year lunar s0lar cyde. The Maya, Inca, and Aztecs identified the same 209/2IO-days 0f lunar/s0lar separati0n.

In 0rder t0 make up an annual f0recast, y0u must refer t0 my Master 20-year F0recasting Chart and see h0w these cydes have w0rked 0ut in the past. As stated bef0re, the 20-year cyde is the m0st imp0rtant cyde f0r f0recasting future market m0vements. It is 0ne-third 0f the 6O-year cyde and when three 20-year cydes run 0ut, imp0rtant bull and bear campaigns terminate.

—W. D. Gann

Biblical ages given f0r Adam indude b0th primary and sec0ndary. Time is measured fr0m birth 0f the named father t0 the birth 0f the next individual in the same family tree. The pattem devel0ps an ex- tensive calendar. Sec0ndary cyde beats are the time fr0m birth 0f the next s0n until death 0f the father. Halving and d0ubling 0f time was h0w the ancient lunar/s0lar calendars were defined. Adam is I30 years. In a 36O° cyde Seth is IOS years with a sec0nd I30-year divisi0n.

Genesis 5:3

“And Adam lived a hundred and thirty years, and begat a s0n in his 0wn likeness, after his image; and called his name Seth.”

Genesis 5:6

“And Seth lived a hundred and five years, and begat En0s.”

Biblical Time is a harm0nic rati0. 1 have seen several the0ries fr0m 0thers ab0ut biblical calculati0ns t0 explain Gann’s references. These the0ries all apply basic arithmetic principles 0f calculati0n and pr0p0se the year is greater than 36S days. That is the same err0r we discussed in the mathematics discussi0n in Chapter IO where the additi0n and

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

subtracti0n 0f harm0nic rati0s is very different fr0m linear mathe- matics. These auth0rs fail t0 understand why a Perfect Fifth and a Perfect F0urth harm0nic rati0 never exceed 36O°.

Adam (I30) + Seth (IOS) plus I30, equals 36S. In Chapter IO in Figure IO.I8, displaying the wheel 0f Perfect Fifths, it is easier n0w t0 sh0w these biblical references 0f time f0r Adam and Seth super- imp0sed 0ver the wheel 0f Perfect Fifths in Figure 20.1. These are harm0nic intervals. Pe0ple wh0 devel0p their hyp0theses fr0m arithmetic means 0f additi0n and subtracti0n will always have c0n- dusi0ns that exceed the 36O° cirde.

He had pr0ved by study and c0mparing past cydes that a time 0r a seas0n referred t0 in the Bible meant 36O days, 36O years, 0r 36O degrees, —a measure kn0wn and used by the astr0l0gers in 0lden times and still un- derst00d and used by m0dem astr0l0gers f0r measuring time. He knew that half a time meant I8O degrees, I8O days 0r years, because Ezekiel had said that the L0rd had app0inted a day f0r a year.

~—W.D. Gann, Tunnel Thru The Air, p. 37I.

B. BIBLE CALCULATIONS OF TIME

Here are the main takeaway p0ints fr0m the list 0f b00ks in my end n0tes:

Biblical references t0 days and years use a different unit t0 measure time. But a day being a th0usand d0es n0t change the numeric rati0s derived fr0m the calculati0ns. As time is defined by intervals and rati0s within 36O°, we are w0rking with harm0nic rati0s and n0t arithmetic rati0s.

* Adam is “I30” years using a 36O-day calendar year. This defines

3I4 the 26O-day “sacred year.” The sacred year divided by 2 equals the age 0f Adam when he fathered Seth.

* A 36S-day s0lar year is a unit derived fr0m a 26O-year sacred cyde plus IOS, which is time split fr0m the 2IO-cyde defined bel0w.

* The I9-Year cyde fr0m the Mes0p0tamian lunar/s0lar calendar results in a 209/2IO lunar/s0lar differential, in a 20-year cyde.

* A Great cyde is 730O sacred years 0f 26O days each. V(730O + 26O) = 87.

* The number I8,720 days divided by the 26O-day sacred year equals 72.

* The 36O-day year times 20 equals 720O.

* 720O X 20 = I44,OOO. We kn0w VI44 = I2, a Jupiter cyde.

* The I30-year age 0f Adam times 36O = 46,8OO

* 46,8OO divided by a 26O-day sacred year equals I8O sacred years ... 0r half the cirde 0f time.

* The En0ch calendar gives I820 and when divided by the 26O- sacred year is the sacred 7-years cyde.

C. THE 9O- AND 4S-YEAR CYCLES (S4O AND IO8O MONTHS)

Gann is again using cydes defined in the Bible. Genesis 5:9 “And En0s lived ninety years, and begat Cainan.” Gann writes in his C0m- m0dities C0urse in F0recasting Grains by Time Cydes: 1. The Great Time Cydes are m0st imp0rtant because they rec0rd the peri0ds 0f extreme high 0r l0w prices. The cydes are 9O- Years, 82 t0 84 Years, 60 Years, 4S Years, and 20 Years.

2. He c0ntinues 0n page IO6: “When we start fr0m Sunrise 0r the H0riz0n and measure t0 N00n, we get an arc 0f 9O degrees... 9O

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

m0nths 0r 9O years is a very imp0rtant time peri0d... because it is tw0 times 4S. This time-peri0d must always be watched at the end 0f l0ng time peri0ds. F0r example:

I932 was 9O years fr0m I842. Study the Wheat prices ar0und this time. I8SO-I8SI— add 9O years and we get I94O-4I. N0te l0w prices 0f Wheat ar0und that time. I8SS, June, high f0r Wheat = I7O. 9O years fr0m this peri0d gives I94S. Wheat reached high in June, selling at I7O, s0me c0ntracts at I68 and I69. I8SO-I8SI, extreme l0ws f0r Wheat. Add 4S years and we get I89S when extreme l0w was reached. Fr0m I89S we again add 4S years and

get I94O.”

Figure 20.2 rec0rds the Annual Wheat Prices in England fr0m I2S9 t0 I938. The insert is Gann’s Annual Seas0nal Study 0f Wheat Prices fr0m I847 t0 I938. T0 read Gann’s insert y0u take a slice 0f price data 0ver a ten-year peri0d and repeat m0ving up t0 the next IO-year interval. The price intervals are then 0verlaid 0ne 0n an0ther t0 help visualize similar trends within a given seas0n. Figure 20.2 has ten 0verlaid pl0ts making the seas0nal study valuable. The April time frame sh0ws the tendency f0r higher prices in spring f0ll0wed by dedines int0 the fall. The first trade in Tunnel describes the ex- pected rise 0f grains int0 the spring seas0nal cyde c0mpared t0 winter price levels.

Gann’s C0ffee Letter was very dear ab0ut the imp0rtance 0f spring trends, and we have examples sh0wing that he tracked these trends f0r a century 0r m0re. The C0ffee Letter in Figure 27.3 lists aspects 0f interest t0 him int0 spring. But there is m0re t0 it than just what he listed. As an example, R0bert G0rd0n’s trades in Tunnel, called the great campaign, are Grand Trines.

A Grand Trine is when tw0 sl0w-m0ving planets are I20° 0f sepa- rati0n and a faster planet 0r the Sun cr0sses their midp0int t0 c0mplete a triangle. There will be a planet b0dy 0n each c0mer 0f the triangle. The Grand Trine in Tunnel has Mercury transit int0 p0siti0n, then a m0nth later the Sun transits t0 where Mercury had been stati0ned, creating the triangle pattem again. We will n0t use a planetary pattem in is0lati0n ever. When y0u examine these pattems 0n y0ur 0wn, may 1 rec0mmend y0u use data sets 0f a hundred years? Then, test a sh0rter near-term interval t0 see if y0ur cyde findings are still relevant. We will d0 this in the chapters that f0ll0w. As a general statement 1 0nly take n0tice 0f the pattems called Y0d, Grand Trines and Grand Cr0sses. 1 d0 n0t track all pattems like Kites and such. 1 feel 1 d0 catch the aspects that f0rm 0ther pattems thr0ugh m0nit0ring individual events that duster t0gether in the chart.

Figure 20.3 is Silver fr0m I972 t0 20I8 in a 2-m0nth bar chart. The chart has tw0 planetary lines. One is Heli0centric Satum and the 0ther planetary line is Ge0centric Plut0. There is a set 0f Fan Angles 0n the data. The astr0l0gical events are Plut0 Retr0grade and Ge0 Jupiter transiting 15O° repeats. What 1 w0uld like y0u t0 n0tice is

that the charts in this b00k are pred0minately dean and unduttered. There is the percepti0n that y0u thr0w everything y0u have 0r kn0w int0 0ne chart and h0pe t0 see s0mething. That is n0t Gann analysis. D0n’t change the time frame thinking that this chart can be used f0r several different time h0riz0ns. Figure 20.3 has 0nly 0ne missi0n in life. Simple. Big picture. Five t00ls added. D0ne. Y0u have a per- manent chart and the w0rk is c0mplete f0r a l0ng time. Want data in a time frame y0u trade? Create a different chart...with the appr0priate meth0ds; the meth0ds applied in a 2-m0nth chart will never be y0ur weekly chart setup.

Figure 20.4 sh0ws the DJIA fr0m the I920s t0 20I8. Using the marked high in I929, 1 have marked the 9O-year 0r IO8O-m0nth cyde. Rec0gnize the number 0f m0nths, being IO8O, is an imp0rtant number. Divide IO8O by 36O t0 see it c0mpletes 3 full r0tati0ns 0f a 36O° cirde. The 9O-year cyde beat is c0ming in 20I9.

In terms 0f cirde r0tati0ns, 2 times 36O° in m0nths w0uld be 720. 720 divided by I2 equals 6O. The 9O-year cyde is n0t just a l0ng beat t0 be used at face value 0nly.

The half cyde 0f IO8O m0nths is S4O m0nths. The start 0f the current bull market began I974 at the 4S-year cyde. But n0w what? What d0 we d0 until the l0ng cyde 0f 9O years strikes again? M0st pe0ple will m0ve d0wn t0 the next sh0rter interval with0ut further th0ught. But we in fact are n0t d0ne using 9O years because it is a 36O° mea- surement 0f time. Time units are als0 degrees that we can use t0 track planetary transits.

Figure 20.4 0f the DJIA indudes the measurements 0f S4O-m0nths and IO8O-m0nths ending the cyde next year in 20I9. The 4S-year cyde is the syn0dic peri0d 0f Satum and Uranus. Figure 20.4 sh0ws the Heli0centric 9O° Satum and Uranus 4S° transit. The cyde beat

tracks every 9O° 0r 4S° p0siti0n change 0n their 0rbital path. The start is at Aries 0. Heli0centric will rem0ve the cyde n0ise 0f the retr0grade m0ti0n. But if the cyde starts at Aries 0°, d0es this mean Aries 0 is Aries 0 plus the 0ffset? Yes. The ancient’s 0ffset sh0uld be used when a z0diac measurement is being applied. H0wever, th0ugh y0u might have applied the 0ffset, y0u want y0ur displayed 0utput t0 read “Aries 0.” It sh0uld remain hidden. The Hermetic Key sh0uld n0t be in view t0 every0ne. This has n0 impact 0n aspect calculati0ns 0r natal cydes that will be c0vered later.

D. THE 84-YEAR URANUS CYCLE

The Earth year ar0und the Sun is a standard 0f measurement. Gann and Jensen reference the appr0ximate peri0d 0f rev0luti0n f0r each planet as f0ll0ws:

Earth 36S days and 7 h0urs Mercury 88 days

Venus 224 days

Mars 1 year 322 days Jupiter 11 years and 3I4 days Satum 29 years I67 days Uranus 84 years

Neptune I67 Years I67 days M00n 28 days ar0und Earth

F0r business cydes we are primarily interested in the planets Jupiter, Satum, and Uranus. When these planets are 9O° and I8O° apart they are 0ften ass0ciated with ec0n0mic d0wntums. H0wever, there is a catch: These aspects 0nly have a high pr0bability 0f f0recasting an

3I9 ec0n0mic d0wntum when they are in a specific z0diac p0siti0n. When the same planets are 6O° 0r I20° 0f separati0n, the generalist will tell us, these aspects c0rrelate t0 rising ec0n0mic c0nditi0ns. N0t true. These aspects must als0 align in specific z0diac signs t0 make such a statement. We will examine the American Ec0n0mic Business Cyde in Chapter 32 as it relates t0 astr0n0mical events.

When William Herschel disc0vered Uranus in I78I it was first seen in Gemini. Uranus spends ab0ut seven years in a z0diac sign. Jensen writes in Astr0-Cydes & Speculative Markets, Chapter 5, “The Uranus Cyde} that “astr0n0mical calculati0ns indicate that the planet Uranus cr0ssed the 8th and 9th degrees 0f the z0diacal sign Gemini in the year 1523 c0inciding with the first settlement 0f the land.” (He is referring here t0 Fl0rida.) He als0 states in an earlier paragraph that “late in 1523 the first f0rmal grant 0f c0nquest and settlement was issued. The first settlement was launched under d’Ayll0n, n0t far fr0m the same sp0t 0n which Jamest0wn was f0unded.”

1 believe Jensen intended t0 write 1526 because 0nly then d0 the dates 0f significance align t0 Uranus 8° t0 9° in Gemini f0r the United States.

1 kn0w it will be hard t0 read the text 0n the left side in Figure 20.5. The l0ngitudes f0r Satum and Uranus are:

20. Gann Time Cydes Evaluated

Figure 20.5 sh0ws Uranus is p0siti0ned 0n each 0f these dates in Gemini with a l0ngitude 0f 69°. T0 find the 20diac equivalent, multiply 30 twice as there are 30° per z0diac sign. Subtract 6O fr0m 69 as Uranus m0ved c0mpletely thr0ugh tw0 z0diac signs, the re- mainder gives the p0siti0n 0f 9° Gemini.

Jupiter is making an interesting spiral in Figure 20.5, but 0ur study and f0cus is 0n the 84-year planetary alignment 0f Uranus zn Gemunt. B0th Jensen and Gann require their readers t0 check their w0rk. In this example the instructi0ns are c0rrect, but the year given is 0ff by 3 years. Jensen gave us the due f0r checking his statement. It is the c0mment ab0ut d’Ayll0n. When 1 researched this name, the c0rrect year c0uld be f0und. It was indeed 1526. On April I3 Lucas Vasquez de Ayll0n rec0rded Spain’s failed c0l0ny in S0uth Car0lina. Ayll0n persuaded Charles V t0 give him the title “Adelantad0” usually re- served f0r Spanish fr0ntier 90vem0rs and c0nquer0rs. He was given permissi0n t0 plant a c0l0ny in Chic0ra. Chic0ra was the name given by Native Indians in the mainland area in latitude 33° 30’. The land was taken in the name 0f the King 0f Spain.

This Uranus cyde fr0m 1526 had several n0table peri0ds in American hist0ry. A specific date that triggers a series 0f events is called the C0merst0ne where the cyde began. Using 1526 as an example, the f0ll0wing events 0ccur:

8/11/I692: The fam0us Salem witchcraft trials begin, Spring 0f I692.

7/I4/I776: In 0rb with July 4", I776.

6/2S/I86O: Abraham Linc0ln is N0minated President 0f the United States this year.

6/O6/I944: This is the exact date 0f D-Day in W0rld War 11 when

32I

15S,OOO Allied tr00ps st0rmed the beaches 0f N0rmandy, France—the largest amphibi0us military 0perati0n in hist0ry.

5/20/2028: T0 Be Determined, but it will be a date 0f hist0ric signif- icance. (Als0 see Figure 20.6 described in the next cyde discussi0n.)

Aspects always have a range defined fr0m when the aspect “Enters” the accepted 0rb wind0w, the peri0d it is exact, and when it “leaves” the 0rb angle 0f separati0n all0wed.

When y0u use s0ftware t0 create this list there will be many m0re dates than th0se listed ab0ve. Why? S0ftware assumes y0u want ge0- centric. T0 rem0ve the back and f0rth retr0grade m0ti0n we can use heli0centric. Gann used b0th Heli0centric and Ge0centric.

The final p0int being made here is that when Uranus is in Gemini 9° AND there are 0pp0siti0ns, c0njuncti0ns, 0r squares with 0ther planets... ec0n0mic st0rms d0 break 0ut. When Uranus is in 0pp0- siti0n, c0njuncti0n, square, and less s0 trine 0r sextile at any time, it is a time cyde 0f interest.

E. THE S6-YEAR CYCLE

In I932 the Astr0l0gical Bulletina published a paper by J. M. Funk called The Cydes 0f Pr0sperity and Depressi0n discussing a S6-year cyde in business. What was interesting ab0ut this w0rk was the c0ncept 0f vertical and h0riz0ntal peri0ds. H0wever, Funk’s w0rk ended with the I929 cyde.

Gann describes this c0ncept 0f cyde analysis in vertical and h0ri- z0ntal m0vement 0n page 224 in Tunnel. Gann uses the w0rd wheel t0 mean cyde in this passage.

He had c0nstructed a wheel within a wheel s0 that he c0uld l0wer his plane and land anywhere he ch0se and c0uld rise straight up. One m0t0r

Figure 20.6 is my chart using the same sequence 0f a 20-year cyde in r0ws and the S6-year cyde in c0lumns. In Gann speech, “He c0uld drive his plane backwards 0r f0rwards.... The wings were s0 arranged they c0uld either remain stati0nary 0r be set in m0ti0n up 0r d0wn....”

The cyde series f0ll0wing the I929 crash in Figure 20.6 is I9S2, I972, I98S, 20O8, and 2028. But the year I929 has an 0ffset 0f 3 years. Why? 1 m0ved the interval f0rward after I929 fr0m I929 t0 I932

The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

because 0f a statement Gann makes in Tunnel. Tunnel, page 372, defined the cyde c0merst0ne anch0r Gann used, “and that fr0m 2933 t0 I982 w0uld be the f0rty-nine years 0f the great jubilee.”

1 first m0ved the c0merst0ne anch0r fr0m I929 t0 I932, the actual price l0w. But 1 als0 created a similar table using a 0ne-time 0ffset 0f 4 years t0 m0ve the c0merst0ne t0 Gann’s I933 retracement price l0w. It gave me a target wind0w that began in 20O8. Gann instructs us several times in his w0rk that the extreme l0w ends the 0ld campaign, 0r trend, and the first pullback that fails t0 break the extreme is the true start 0f the new trend and the safer entry. 1 c0rrectly wamed 0f the 20O8 bear market in the b00k Breakthr0ughs in Technical Analysis: New Thinking fr0m the W0rld's T0p Minds. On page IO4, 1 wr0te, “Gann’s meth0ds wam that the years 20O8 t0 20I2 will be difficult 0nes.”

There was a duster 0f bearish astr0n0mical events fr0m 20O8 t0 20I2. When there is a wide c0nfluence z0ne in time 1 lean 0n Elli0tt wave structure and Gann ge0metric angles. An0ther useful additi0n is t0 be very aware 0f the number 0f bars fr0m the c0merst0ne. We will study h0w t0 mark time inflecti0n targets using the square r00t. As an example, the square 0f I2 is I44 and we w0uld want t0 kn0w the I44 bar fr0m a c0merst0ne. We will keep track 0f the bar 0r calendar days f0r all the square r00t numbers.

Had 1 n0t m0ved the C0merst0ne based 0n Tunnel, 1 w0uld have been three years t00 early. 1 then c0ntinued the cyde 0f +S6-years d0wn in c0lumns and 20-year intervals al0ng r0ws.

20. Gann Time Cydes Evaluated

0ccurs in sh0rt interval cydes such as m00n phases far m0re 0ften than in l0nger cydes. This is evident fr0m the catastr0phic events 0f 20O8. The inverted cyde did n0t change the sequence within the larger cyde rhythm 0f d0wn beats.

Why did 1 put “War?” bel0w the year 2028? The year 2028 is the sixth cyde 0f the ‘S6/20 table’ and in syne with W0rld War 1. We have a maj0r dedine appr0aching late 20I9 t0 202I. Wars can f0ll0w seven years after a gl0bal financial c0ntracti0n due t0 res0urce lim- itati0ns and instability rippling thr0ugh emerging market c0untries as a result 0f the ec0n0mic crisis.

The S6-year cyde is very d0se t0 the Jupiter—Uranus cyde 0f I3.8I years times f0ur, which equals SS.24 years. Let me sh0w y0u h0w 1 test t0 find the “h0t angle” between tw0 planets.

Using Timing S0luti0n s0ftware, 1 can pl0t an Annual Seas0nal study 0f all angles 0f separati0n between Jupiter and Uranus. My data test passes because there are m0re than 3 c0mplete cydes in my data sample. (Three cydes are required at a minimum. One cyde at I3.8I years, times 3, equals ab0ut 40 years 0f data minimum needed). What 1 want t0 kn0w are the angles that are the market inflecti0n h0t sp0ts. D0 n0t assume the standard aspects 0f c0njuncti0n, 0pp0- siti0n, square, and trine are the exact angles the test will reveal. In Figure 20.7 the x-axis sh0ws a graduated scale 0f grays. The black band within Figure 20.7 is a bright red c0l0r fr0m 100° t0 I20°. It is a waming that the inflecti0n p0int in this market, the 5&PsS0O, has a h0t sp0t that starts earlier than the I20° trine aspect.

The cyde test results add c0nfidence that the angles in general between these tw0 planets are significant with trend analysis f0r the 5&PSOO. The next step is t0 pl0t the cyde in a c0ntinu0us timeline presentati0n under the price data as sh0wn in Figure 20.8. The in-

323 terval f0r 0ne c0mplete cyde is I3.8I years. The Jupiter—Uranus c0n- juncti0ns pr0duced market l0ws, yet the summati0n seas0nal graph failed t0 define these as h0t sp0ts.

There is an imp0rtant series that falls in the S6-peri0d cyde family. Gann marked a small ‘“’ caret 0n s0me charts that marked a reference t0 the N0rth N0de 0f the M00n. This is a cyde beat when the N0rth N0de passes thr0ugh a specific ediptic plane with a high c0rrelati0n t0 financial panics. We will c0ver this in depth and c0mputer-test 0ur the0ry in a later chapter. The general range is Taurus t0 the Gemini/ Capric0m cusp. Testing w0uld suggest 15° Aries t0 15° Gemini c0uld be called the financial panic butt0n. We will examine this cyde very carefully.

F. GANN’5 49-YEAR CYCLE IN TUNNEL

The questi0n is where d0es Gann find his 49-year cyde? Y0u will find the cyde discussed in Tunnel 0n page 37I:

[He knew that] the measurement used thru0ut the Bible was by sc0res and man’s span 0f life was three sc0re years and ten [see 0ur discussi0n _ in the 0pening segment 0f this chapter], and that f0ur hundred and f0rty _ years equalled twenty-tw0 sc0res, leaving tw0 sc0res 0r f0rty year m0re f0r the c0mpleti0n 0f the jubilee years.

Key f0r us n0w is t0 understand that a sabbatical year (discussed in the Bible at Leviticus 2S:8—S4) is the seventh year, that 7 x 7 Sab- batical years are 49 years, and that the Jubilee Year is the year at the end 0f seven Sabbatical years, 0r the S0th year. Gann c0ntinues:

He read Matthew I8:2I and 22: “Then came Peter t0 him, and said, L0rd, h0w 0ft shall my br0ther sin against me, and 1 f0rgive him? Till seven — times? Jesus saith unt0 him, 1 say n0t unt0 thee, Until seven times; but, —

The t0p f0ur cydes identified f0r Crude Oil, and the DJIA w0uld need t0 be retested with sh0rter data sets t0 ensure the cydes are still active in their current market. Figure 20.9 is n0t a permanent template 0f cyde peri0ds.

Oil c0ntained a 49.76-year cyde. The DJIA c0ntained a 47-year cyde, and Dubai 4S-years with minimal required data. This is a wide range in years if we are l00king f0r 49. The table f0r Dubai c0ntained the m0st interesting result. This test is a harm0nic cyde with a limited number 0f harm0nic 0vert0nes as described in Chapter IO. The results in Figure 20.9 are 354.5, I8O, 88-89, 6O, and 4S. The first is near the Egyptian calendar; the I8O, 6O, and 4S need n0 explaining because we interchange these values between units 0f time, angles, and price 0ften. (Figure 9.1 may pr0ve t0 be a helpful visual guide t0 the cr0ss interacti0ns we will c0ntinually be using.)

The 49-year cyde may n0t test well in the unit 0f years, but the square 0f 7 value d0es indeed have several applicati0ns in the 5&P SOO. If the face value 0f a Gann statement seems t0 be in questi0n, l00k deeper int0 its use and meaning. Here is 0ne meth0d where 1 use the square 0f 7.

Figure 20.IO is the daily 5&PsOO Cash Index. The cyde marked within the data is a ge0centric 49° Mercury transit with repeats. What d0es that mean? 1 want t0 kn0w the 49° cyde p0siti0n beginning fr0m Aries 0°. That defines a start at I9° Taurus. But 1 d0 n0t want t0 track the beat just every time Mercury arrives at I9° Taurus, what 1 really want is the cyde beat rec0rded every 49th degree Mercury has m0ved al0ng its 0rbital path 0ver a 36O° retum t0 Aries 0°. Then 1 want t0 reset the start again at Taurus I9°. The cyde then repeats the Mercury transit every 49°. If 1 did n0t reset after the retum t0 Aries, 1 w0uld n0t be starting the next cyde set at Taurus I9°. This is exactly like 0ur music scale discussi0n in Figures IO.1 and IO.I8. The Pytha90rean scale has a tweak interval bef0re the Pytha90rean scale can start the next 0ctave. This was best dem0nstrated in Figure IO.IO in the 5&PSOO m0nthly chart with Pytha90rean intervals. The c0ncept is the same in this applicati0n when we need t0 reset the start t0 Aries 0°.

What is a t0nic n0te f0r the cyde in Figure 20.IO? Is it Aries 0° 0r Taurus I9°? The c0rrect answer between these tw0 0pti0ns is Aries 0°. But Figure 20.IO is an applicati0n where the Hermetic Key sh0uld be applied as this example is z0diac dependent. It was n0t used t0 make it easier f0r y0u t0 see the ge0centric 49° transit cyde. The true start will use the 0ffset and begin slightly later m0ving all the cyde beats f0rward. We w0uld then see the cyde reset at the same 0ffset in Aries. When we use sl0wer transiting planets such as Plut0, 0ur

true cyde beat will be very early if we start at Aries 0° and ign0re the 0ffset.

Interesting, isn’t it? The Figure 20.IO beats d0 n0t imply a d0wn beat like a c0nventi0nal fixed cyde. It is als0 dear that this is n0t a fixed cyde, due t0 an elliptic 0rbital path and inc0nsistent speed. This calculati0n is ge0centric, and timing is impacted by the retr0grade m0ti0n. Once y0u start l00king int0 this way t0 define a cyde, there will be very few fixed cydes 0n y0ur charts.

Figure 20.11 is the 5&PSOO Cash Index m0nthly data. This is a Mars cyde that 0nly tracks a 36O° retum t0 I9° Taurus 0r 49° fr0m Aries 0°. The c0rrelati0n between the cyde and price t0ps is impressive. 1 0nly take n0tice 0f the 49° cyde f0r transiting Mercury and Mars. If we get picky, 1 can ask if the cyde beats are early? Yes. Did 1 use the 0ffset? N0. The timing then bec0mes even m0re impressive. A m0re advanced reader will have a questi0n in mind: D0 y0u apply the 0ffset t0 a natal cyde? The answer is n0. That is n0t z0diac dependent; it is a selected time tied t0 a specific price bar as 0ur starting beat. If y0u are new t0 this material, just let that 0ne fl0w 0ff y0u f0r n0w, and it will be here in the right place 0n a sec0nd reading.

N0w y0u may think th0se last tw0 charts were very c00l, but 72° transits in financial markets are equally interesting. This interval will be repeated several times in this b00k. D0n’t f0rget that they reset at the 36O° cusp, and y0u will be using the repeats. The reset means the cyde will always be in the same starting z0diac p0siti0n. This is similar t0 the harm0nic intervals created in Figure IO.1.

While 1 was w0rking 0n this segment, Crude Oil fell tw0 d0llars thr0ugh the day due t0 fears China w0uld put a tariff 0n Oil, which is unlikely as they are the buyers, but the media excuse tried t0 explain the m0ve. Oil was at $68 having pulled back fr0m a July high near

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

$7S. Oil was c0ming up int0 the last cyde 0f the duster. Clients were advised that Oil was nearing a fall t0wards $48. It has n0thing t0 d0 with the news. H0wever, the Shanghai t0pped in January and has fallen int0 recent l0ws in August with m0re t0 90 t0 the d0wnside. A sl0wd0wn in China d0es n0t h0ld 900d things f0r 0ther c0untries, like India, that depend 0n the Chinese ec0n0my. The recent Crude Oil price high was 0n the Gann astr0n0mical duster displayed in Figure 20.I2. The same duster had t0pped Oil in 20I3 and at the hist0ric high in the chart. Always be aware 0f pattems and key piv0ts ass0- ciated with a cyde. S0me will think 1 am adding ec0n0mic fact0rs. 1 understand gl0bal cash fl0ws and we always need t0 ask 0urselves, If this is true, then c0uld this als0 be true? In this case, 1 d0n’t think China puts 0n an Oil tariff. The market d0es think tariffs 0n Oil are c0ming. That fact0r timed with a Gann Fact0r c0uld be valuable in- f0rmati0n. M0re valuable again if y0ur wave c0unt aligns with mine sh0wing that Oil is in a f0urth wave rally n0w. Figure 20.I2 is an update t0 Figure IO.I4 captured 0n August 8th, 20I8. The price has n0w realized and reacted t0 the c0ncentric cirde as resistance. The duster 0f astr0n0mical events indude: Plut0 and Uranus retr0grade, Ge0 Sun 88° transit, and Mercury 72° transit. If y0u skipped Chapter IO, that is where the Pytha90rean intervals 0f c0ncentric cirdes 0f supp0rt and resistance are described.

Time Fact0rs are always the m0st imp0rtant. The $48 target is derived fr0m c0nverting a l0ngitude 0n a Time Fact0r int0 a price 0b- jective. This will be much easier t0 d0 than y0u may think n0w. Why? A gr0up 0f cydes that trigger a trend reversal will 0ften devel0p int0 the end 0f the m0ve. Over the years 1 have f0und this kn0wledge t0 be valuable when c0upled with the c0nfluence 0f dia90nal and h0ri- z0ntal supp0rt 0r resistance.

Figure 20.I3 is a 3-day Crude Oil Futures chart n0w a m0nth later in September. The white cirdes are a full m00n phase. The price high was at a maj0r c0nfluence z0ne 0f resistance where tw0 Gann Square 0f Nine targets 0verlap.

What 0ther markets sh0uld we study at this time as energy traders? The Saudi TASI and T0r0nt0 TSX st0ck markets, as b0th c0unties are energy pr0ducers. Other than EURUSD, what currency sh0uld be analyzed? The CADJPY, the Canadian D0llar/ Japanese Yen cr0ss. Many chapters have passed since 1 first men- ti0ned these markets as useful guides f0r the energy trader. This is a gentle reminder that we d0n’t f0cus 0n just 0ne market and that these 0ther markets c0upled with Oil are very useful when a maj0r piv0t in Oil needs c0nfirmati0n. We will 0ften see the re- versal devel0p in these 0ther markets adding t0 0ur c0nfidence and t0 the pr0bability that we are seeing things c0rrectly in the primary market.

G. THE 30-YEAR SATURN CYCLE

The 30-year cyde is the Satum cyde that is m0re accurately stated as the 29.46-year cyde. This is 90ing t0 be used as an angle that 1 will dem0nstrate step-by-step when 1 c0ver Gann’s C0ffee Letter.

Gann is ab0ut astr0n0mical cydes and n0t fixed mechanical cydes. We study cydes 0n an ellipse. H0wever, 1 believe there is an0ther 0versight in 0ur industry’s belief that the peri0d 0f a wavelength is always equal t0 0ne, meaning all cydes have a fixed peri0d. Have y0u ever c0nsidered what w0uld happen t0 a cyde pattem if lambda was less than 1? What if lambda was greater than 1? The greater than 0r less than pattems f0r a wavelength are in Figure 20.I4, yet we d0 n0t test these physics pr0perties 0f waves.

H. THE 20-YEAR GANN PERPETUAL MAP OF THE NYSE

The 20-year cyde was dem0nstrated in 0ur discussi0n 0f Figure 20.6. Satum c0njuncts Jupiter every I9.86 years. (Satum c0njuncts Uranus every 4S.36 years.) This was 0nly 0ne example 0f Gann’s use 0f the 20-year cyde. Gann created a 20-year cyde as a Perpetual Map 0f the New Y0rk St0ck Exchange. T0 aid 0ur discussi0n it has been re- pr0duced in Figure 20.I6. In the I934 distributi0n 0f C0urse Eleven, which later became the St0ck C0urse C0llecti0n, Gann wr0te:

Figure 20.I6 is Gann’s Perpetual NYSE Map extended t0 add the relevant years f0r t0day.

First step was t0 leam a little hist0ry and find the traumatic years that st00d 0ut. N0t every year marked in Figure 20.I6 is in the list bel0w, but this gives y0u the idea 0f what 1 was hunting t0 find.

I793 England 90es t0 War with France.

I796-97 Land Speculati0n Bubble Burst. Feb 2S, I797. See http://en. wikipedia.0rg /wiki/Panic_0f_I796.

I8I2 The War 0f I8I2 was 32mth between USA and GB. In GB started 2 decades 0f stagnati0n called the “L0ng Depressi0n.”

I87I Chica90 Fire.

I873 Panic 0f I873 triggered a depressi0n in Eur0pe and USA until I879.

I893 The Panic 0f I893 was the w0rst ec0n0mic depressi0n, resulting in 97% bank failures. (Railr0ad Bubble c0llapse.) See http://en.wikipedia.0rg/wiki/Panic_ 0f_I893.

I9O2-O3 DJIA is 0nly 5-yrs 0ld when the first bear market 0ccurs (-46.1%) (I929 crash was -47.9%, I930-32 l0ss -86.0%).

I9O7 Called the “Panic 0f I9O7,” T0tal l0ss —48.5%.

I9I4 The NYSE was d0sed f0r much 0f the latter part 0f

I9I4 (WWr).

335

I9I6, Feb 2 Germany starts attacking U.5. shipping. I9I9-I92I P0st WWI B00m terminates with a c0llapse (-46.6%). I974* = 42-yr l0w with I932 l0w. 7-yr l0w fr0m I967.

Midp0int 0f I7-yr cyde fr0m the I966 t0p.

* The I974 year 1 used because it als0 induded a duster 0f astr0l0gical events. The Chica90 Fire and San Francisc0 earthquake events were in- duded because they had a maj0r ec0n0mic impact 0n the United States as a nati0n.

The years 0f bearish activity are marked in a red b0x. In Figure 20.I6 they will be the very dark gray b0xes. When y0u study the sequence, a few stand 0ut, but 1 did n0t get it until 1 added the 4S° angles 0n the dia90nal axis. Then a pattem emerged f0r me. N0tice the bearish events all 0ccur 0n the dia90nal angles. N0tice what happens at the intersecti0ns. The years 20I9 t0 202I are c0ming up.

The light gray shaded b0xes just mark years 0n the 4S° angle t0 help me draw the dia90nals.

But this idea is n0t the end 0f the applicati0n. Figure 20.I7 is Gann’s Master 36O° Cirde Chart. In Chapter 30 we will l00k at h0w Gann c0nverted the Cirde Chart int0 this Table, which is very imp0rtant. Figure 20.I7 is c0nstructed in increments 0f 15 with the first c0lumn running upwards fr0m 5 t0 36O. Each c0lumn starts a new rev0luti0n 0f a cirde.

The r0ws are marked in the left margin in increments 0f 1 t0 24. The divisi0n 0f I2 will equate t0 30°s 0f l0ngitude. Theref0re 24 w0uld be 15° 0f l0ngitude. The square 0f I2 by I2 is further marked by angles 0n the b0tt0m 0f each c0lumn in increments 0f 30° and by eighths and thirds. Y0u may recall fr0m Figure IO.1 that 30° increments were used t0 begin 0ur intr0ducti0n t0 music ge0metry as well. Numbers

that fall 0n the dia90nal fr0m the b0tt0m left c0mer t0 the t0p right c0mer 0n the I2 x I2 square, and the dedining dia90nal fr0m the I2 X 1 square t0 1 X I2 will be imp0rtant when the ge0metry is f0cused 0n divisi0ns 0f eighths. The c0lumns labeled 1 thr0ugh; in the t0p r0w start a new I2 by I2 Table.

Here is the imp0rtant takeaway: Gann’s Master 36O° square is a spiral. The square r00t 0f I9 begins a new r0tati0n 0n 36I. All th0se many years a90 when 1 first asked, “why are s0me Gann targets als0 Fib0nacci numbers, but n0t all? Why when the tw0 f0rm a c0nfluence target d0es the market hit a wall akin t0 the Great Wall 0f China?” 1 had finally f0und my answer.

The ge0metric spiral in the w0rk 0f Ali Ibn Muhammad al-Gurgani in Figure I2.1 can n0w be applied in Figure 20.I8. The square 0f I9 is imp0rtant as it begins the sec0nd spiral 0f the helix. The helix is the ge0metry that makes Gann’s mathematics w0rk. Ge0metry c0mbined with time is the brilliance 0f Gann’s w0rk. Gann had tapped int0 uni- versal pr0p0rti0ns 0f time and space. Only a few have underst00d that Gann’s Wheels are helix spirals.

Figure 20.I9 is a m0dificati0n 0f Figure IO.I8, where we began 0ur study 0f Perfect Fifth intervals. When the Gann Wheel is used in Equal Temperament subdivisi0ns, the cardinal cr0ss angle 0f 27O° 0n the h0riz0ntal axis with 9O° is the c0nventi0nal use. But the Perfect Fifths harm0nic wheel in Figure 20.I9 sh0ws h0w the 20-year time cyde has an interesting fractal pr0perty that can 0nly be seen when 28O° fr0m the Pytha90rean Temperament scale is applied—24O divided by 20 equals I2, twelve is 4 times 3 and the rati0 4:3 is the Perfect F0urth. The 3:2, 0r Perfect Fifth, is in the 6O/4O c0mbinati0n that must use 28O°. The Octave, 0r 2:1 rati0, is f0und in a c0uple 0f ways. The 20-year cyde is the 0nly interval in Gann’s list 0f cydes that

20. Gann Time Cydes Evaluated

Figure 20.20 where the 20-bar cydes are marked as Perfect Fifth and Perfect F0urth cydes. This puts a heavier emphasis 0n s0me 20-year cydes m0re s0 than 0n 0thers when they d0 n0t fall 0n the Perfect Fifth 0r F0urth interval. The Wheat market in Figure 20.20 makes this p0int very dear.

1. THE I8.6-YEAR LUNAR CYCLE 15 NOT THE IQ-YEAR METONIC CYCLE

There is a repeating cyde 0f I8 years, 11 days, and 8 h0urs when lunar and s0lar edipses begin t0 repeat a pattem fr0m the same n0de with the M00n at nearly the same distance fr0m Earth at the same time 0f year. NASA sh0ws that in 20I8 we are in Sar0s Cyde I29.*

A I9-year lunar cyde was kn0wn as the Met0nic Cyde and the basis 0f Greek calendars until the Julian calendar was intr0duced in 46 B.c. Twelve lunar m0nths equal 354.367 days, meaning it is sh0rt 0f the s0lar year by 11 days. Take 235 m0nths, subtract (I9 x I2), and y0u have 7 lunar m0nths that had t0 be added t0 sync with the s0lar cyde. This was d0ne in years 3, 5, 8, 11, I3, I6, and I9. Itis in- teresting that they used a p0rti0n 0f the Fib0nacci series, th0ugh it w0uld n0t be disc0vered until centuries later. Then the square 0f I9 being 36I defines a Natural date that begins a new r0tati0n.

The Met0nic cyde was later extended t0 f0ur I9-year cydes, which was called the Callippic Cyde 0f 94O m0nths 0r 27,7S9 days. There is a lunar cyde that was first calculated by Hipparchus that c0nsists 0f f0ur Callippic cydes minus 0ne day. This cyde is 376O m0nths.

The Astr0l0gical Bulletina b00ks in Gann’s suitcase had a publi- cati0n gap. The Spring 0f I934 v0lume was then f0ll0wed by a I938

publicati0n. Why? It is n0t f0r the c0lumn written by Luther Jensen because that quarter was very brief. Likely the artide 0f interest in the Spring I934 publicati0n was the 0ne 0n pages 113 t0 I22, “S0lar Radiati0n and Business Activity,” f0cusing 0n specific Lunar-S0lar Cydes.

T.0. McGrath begins his artide with “The maj0r rise and fall in mass activates in the past have c0nf0rmed with the variati0ns in s0lar energy and in its distributi0n t0 the earth in cydes 0f S6 years, I8.6 years, appr0ximately 11 years, and the sec0ndary cyde 0f appr0xi- mately 4O m0nths.”

The auth0r equates these cydes t0 s0lar cydes except f0r the I8.6-year cyde where he states, “the I8.6-year peri0d is the time required f0r the n0de 0f the M00n t0 cirde the ediptic and t0 retum t0 the same p0siti0n in the heavens. It is a time cyde... within which the mass activates 0f each generati0n recapitulate, regardless 0f the the0ries 0f men.” That ties back t0 0ur earlier discussi0n that the lifespan 0f man is a recurring theme in Gann’s w0rk.

He 90es 0n t0 say, “A further examinati0n 0f the business rec0rds 0f the past sh0ws that beginning with the b0tt0m 0f the depressi0n in 2822, a severe depressi0n has dimaxed near the end 0f each I8.6-year peri0d theref0re as f0ll0ws:

December....I82I July........ I84O February..... I8S9 September... I877 April....... I896 December... I9I4 July........ I933

---

With the excepti0n 0f the depressi0n 0f I839 and I84O which c0n- tinued until I842, a revival began just bef0re, 0r sh0rtly after, the end 0f each I8.6-year peri0d.”

1 have menti0ned b0th an I8.6- and a I9-year cyde. Is 0ne m0re c0rrect and h0w d0 we use tw0 cydes this d0se t0gether? The answer is we d0 n0t use them b0th. We test them in ways Gann never c0uld. In Chapter 3I we will be devel0ping a c0mputer m0del using a N0rth N0de cyde 0f the M00n. The initial testing in Figure 20.2Ia sh0ws the I8.6-year cyde is being extracted by the c0mputer with0ut sub- jective bias in the annualized transit thr0ugh the z0diac signs. Figure 20.2Ib is a cyde timeline in the 5&PSOO. While this may l00k w0n- derful, there is a pr0blem. Figure 20.2I2 in the t0p line sh0ws 0nly 2.69 cydes have been identified in the data set. We need a minimum 0f 3 cydes, s0 we need a larger data set t0 evaluate this cyde. As a preliminary examinati0n it d0es pique 0ur interest t0 d0 additi0nal research. This will be d0ne in a later chapter.

Astr0-ec0n0mists have analyzed the Jupiter c0njunct Satum aspect against American business cydes since the late I8OOs. It takes Satum ab0ut 30 years t0 0rbit the Sun, and twelve years f0r Jupiter t0 c0mplete 0ne r0tati0n. Because Jupiter is 0n the faster 0rbit, the tw0 b0dies f0rm a c0njuncti0n ab0ut every 20 years. This is Gann’s twenty-year cyde.

J. THE I3.8I-YEAR JUPITER-URANUS CYCLE, AND SYNODIC CYCLES

The Jupiter-Uranus syn0d is I3.8I years fr0m c0njuncti0n t0 c0n- juncti0n. As previ0usly menti0ned, it is imp0rtant t0 rec0gnize that the ellipse-shaped travel means the timing 0f aspect culminati0ns between

The Jupiter-Uranus mean interval between Heli0centric and Ge0- centric aspects 0f C0njuncti0n, Opp0siti0n, and Square is 3.4S years, 0r 4I.5 m0nths. This c0rrelates t0 the 3.5-year business cyde.

S0me ec0n0mists hide behind this cyde t0 acc0unt f0r secular trends.

Weare m0st c0ncemed with the study 0f five planets that define the greater syn0dic cydes. They are Jupiter, Satum, Uranus, Neptune, and Plut0. We track each thr0ugh their transit signs individually, but extensive study in my experience sh0ws that the hist0ric events in business c0rrelate t0 the aspects between these planets. Chapter 32 will 90 int0 greater detail ab0ut the ec0n0mic events in America’s hist0ry that c0rrelate t0 specific astr0n0mical events.

The Jupiter-Uranus cyde cann0t ign0re the individual planet cydes that were extremely imp0rtant t0 Gann. The Jupiter cyde is the I2-year cyde. Whenever Gann used a I2-p0int rise, he was using what he called “the Jupiter cyde.”

Uranus retums t0 the p0siti0n where it began every 84.O2 tr0pical years. But 1 place far m0re imp0rtance 0n planetary relati0nships, the peri0ds required f0r tw0 0r m0re b0dies t0 m0ve 36O° with respect t0 each 0ther, the syn0dic cyde. When heli0centric viewed, the full cirde that has c0mpleted all the aspect relati0nships can be called the syn0d f0r sh0rt.

D0nald Bradley’s b00klet, St0ck Market Predicti0n; The Planetary Bar0meter and H0w t0 Use It, pr0vides a summary that mirr0rs the views written by Luther Jensen’s in Astr0l0gical Bulletina. These planets are kn0wn t0 be ass0ciated t0 business in the f0ll0wing ways:

Jupiter: Currency, Banking, Credit.

Satum: Agriculture, livest0ck, seas0nality 0f wh0lesale prices 0f f00d. Livest0ck prices have a I4.8-year rhythm that c0rrelates t0 Satum’s dedinati0n cyde.

Uranus: St0ck Market, C0rp0rate and Lab0r interests. We will

revisit in the last chapter the panics described in Chapter One. Uranus is the big d0g, s0 t0 speak, with Jupiter aspects.

Neptune: My 0wn experience has taught me that Neptune is Oil. Bradley first br0ught my attenti0n t0 tying this planet t0 Petr0leum.

Plut0: Plut0-Satum 0pp0siti0ns and c0njuncti0ns are imp0rtant; the next culminati0n in this cyde is in May 20I9. 1 f0und the very first aspect search that m0ved me int0 this field in the I99Os. The fact T ended the search range in 2020 sh0ws where 1 th0ught infinity in time was l0cated thirty years a90. The results are in Figure 20.24. 1 guess 1’m ab0ut t0 step b0ldly int0 infinity and bey0nd!

Figure 20.2S 0ffers a visual chart 0f where in the z0diac six Plu- t0-Satum c0njuncti0ns 0ccur fr0m I9I4 t0 20S4. The z0diac p0siti0n 0f an aspect is just as imp0rtant as the aspect culminati0n itself. Wars, recessi0ns, and r0ugh times mark Satum C0njuncti0n and Opp0siti0n Plut0 aspects. Use a summary time table 0f hist0ry t0 make a quick c0mparis0n 0f the dates t0 hist0ric events. Y0u will want t0 search a Jupiter 0pp0siti0n and c0njuncti0ns with Plut0 and cr0ss reference the hist0ry 0f y0ur c0untry als0. This is an excellent aspect f0r s0me0ne new t0 astr0-ec0n0mics t0 begin their research.

20. Gann Time Cydes Evaluated

The 11-year cyde is ass0ciated with the sunsp0t cyde. The c0rrelati0n 0f sunsp0ts t0 dimate and wheat yields was first made by Sir William Herschel wh0se w0rk was published by Adam Smith. M0re ab0ut Her- schel’s w0rk can be f0und 0n page SO8 in Mary J0 Nye’s 20O3 b00k, The Cambridge Hist0ry 0f Science: V0lume 5, “The M0dem Physical and Mathematical Sciences” (Cambridge University Press). Hershel determined that when the number 0f sunsp0ts increased, s0 t00 did Wheat yields. The year 2020 will be an extra0rdinary cyde in the hist0ry 0f data c0llected. 1 will explain sh0rtly. The lesser kn0wn fact ab0ut Hershel: He was n0t an ec0n0mist, but an astr0l0ger.

There has been an extensive am0unt 0f research 0n sunsp0t cydes. Sunsp0t activity impacts Earth’s magnetism. This in tum impacts weather, rainfall, and bar0metric pressure. This in tum impacts ag- riculture pr0ducti0n. Figure 20.26 sh0ws Wheat prices in a 6-m0nth bar chart fr0m I9OO. The l0wer data is the sunsp0t activity cyde. The vertical lines will help y0ur eye track the sunsp0t l0ws t0 the same intervals in the wheat data. If y0u are an agriculture trader, y0u will want t0 study this cyde.

In I848 J0hann Rud0lph W0lf devised a daily meth0d 0f estimating s0lar activity by c0unting the number 0f individual sp0ts and gr0ups 0f sp0ts 0n the face 0f the Sun. He added IO times the number 0f gr0ups t0 the t0tal c0unt 0f individual sp0ts, because quantity al0ne c0m- pletely captures the activity. This meth0d 0f c0unting c0ntinues t0day.

Sunsp0ts create s0lar flares causing magnetic st0rms linked t0 maj0r black0uts and p0wer grid failures in N0rth America. On a Tuesday, N0vember 9, I96S appr0ximately 8O,OOO square miles 0f the N0rtheast, a t0tal 0f eight states, fell int0 darkness, as a triple c0n- duct0r line failed. That failure begins with a faulty relay in T0r0nt0, Canada, the first city impacted by the black0ut. T0r0nt0 went black

at 5:15 p.m. R0chester f0ll0wed at 5:20 p.m., then B0st0n at 5:2I p.m. New Y0rk City went black at 5:28 p.m. The black0ut affected f0ur milli0n h0mes in New Y0rk and left 8OO,OOO pe0ple stranded in the city’s subway system. This d0es n0t c0unt th0se trapped in elevat0rs. J0umalist The0d0re White later wr0te that the black0ut “caused an entire civilizati0n t0 flicker with it.” By midnight, m0re than ninety percent 0f subway passengers were freed. By 4:44 a.m. the next day, p0wer was rest0red t0 Manhattan. 1 had a picture 0f the cause: The Quebec Hydr0 plant had been bumed by the magnetic st0rm. All references t0 the Quebec plant have been deleted fr0m hist0rical rec0rds, which is typical 0f events relating t0 magnetic st0rm damage. When 1 saw the ph0t0graph 0f the damage 1 sh0uld have captured it. In I996 1 th0ught that 0nce s0mething was 0n the Intemet it was carved in st0ne.

An artide in the Oct0ber 28, 20O3 New Y0rk Times by Anahad 0’C0nn0r, “St0rm 0n the Sun C0uld S0w Cha0s 0n Earth, ” artide described the studies 0f Dr. Bruce Tsurutani, a physicist at NASA’s Jet Pr0pulsi0n Lab0rat0ry in Pasadena, Calif0mia. We had just experienced a maj0r magnetic st0rm disrupting satellite services. “There have been 0ther s0lar events that were even m0re extreme than this 0ne, but they didn’t meet the f0ur fact0rs that lead t0 an intense magnetic st0rm,” Dr. Tsurutani said. “On September 1 and 2 in I8S9, th0se f0ur ingredients came t0gether.”

In the United States we have s0mething called the Freed0m 0f Inf0rmati0n Act. It means a civilian can 0btain a dassified U.5. G0vemment D0cument after it has been dedassified. The pr0blem with such d0cuments is that y0u can 0nly get y0ur hands 0n them if y0u kn0w the 90vemment file number. Yes, the end 0f the m0vie Indiana J0nes and the L0st Ark d0es c0me t0 mind as we see the Arc being r0lled int0 the largest building we c0uld imagine in a b0x that l00ks just like the milli0ns 0f 0ther b0xes l0st within these walls.

The U.5. Navy planted a series 0f “DSMs” 0r destructive sea mines during the N0rth Vietnam War in I972. Navy destr0yers experienced and 0bserved a sequence 0f expl0si0ns 0ff Haiph0ng. The findings were highly dassified and deeply hidden in their archives. The cause y0u ask? A magnetic st0rm fr0m s0lar flare activity 0n the Sun. 1 have inserted segments 0f this very l0ng rep0rt.

Destr0yer Underwater Expl0si0ns Beginning 0n 4 June I972, five U.5. Navy destr0yers experienced

varying degrees 0f damage fr0m zer0 t0 inm0bilizati0n as a result 0f d0se ab0ard, underwater expl0si0ns in shall0w water 0ff Vietnam. Alth0ugh a degree 0f uncertainty still exists as t0 whether

fr0m enemy-laid mines, the c0ndusi0ns reached by U.5. N

Hi structure, and intelligence auth0rities after exten gati0n indicate that the destruct0r perf0rmance envel0pe fits the inci- dents m0re d0sely than any kn0wn enemy mines,:

we During the ne90tiati0ns that ended the war and arranged the mine dearance 0perati0ns, the N0rth Vietnamese daimed that the area had been mined by their f0rces. They refused, h0wever, t0 give any further inf0rmati0n 0n the subject, and there is n0 evidence t0 Supp0rt their daim. hen t0ld that the inf0rmati0n 0n the mines was required f0r

the safety 0f U.5. ships, they replied that the mines were all safe and that there was n0 need t0 w0rry ab0ut them.

SS The incidents are 0f significance and interest t0 the hist0ry 0f the mining campaign f0r tw0 reas0ns. First, there is little Vitera- tare, 0ther than test rep0rts, that gives specific results 0f mining. If these were DST 36 expl0si0ns, there is s0mething t0 be leamed 0f their effectiveness with respect t0 a destr0yer target. Sec0ndly,

ue Figure 3-27 is a summary 0f the incidents and Figure 3-28. sh0ws the ge0graphic l0cati0ns.

On 4 June, USS Strauss (DDGI6) was c0nducting a naval gunfire a missi0n ab0ut 20 miles n0rtheast 0f D0ng H0i 0n a track used repeatedly f0r naval gunfire purp0ses when she experienced tw0 expl0si0ns ab0ut I6 sec0nds apart - 0ne being l0cated 100 feet ahead and the 0ther 9S feet 0n the starb0ard beam. Water depth was estimated t0 be 6O t0 100 feet. Strauss was making 2S kn0ts. Alth0ugh she received a c0ating 0f b0tt0m mud as high as her ra > Strauss received n0 hull]

damage and 0nly very light equipment damage as a result 0f these expl0- si0ns.

w0 On I7 duly, USS Harringt0n (8D 843), als0 0n a naval gunfire missi0n

in the same area and using the same general track as the Strauss, re- ceived heavy hull and installati0n damage when she was hit by tw0 under. water expl0si0ns in what were presumably mine-free waters.

The d0sest U.5. DST fields t0 the pizauss/Narr ingt0n expl0si0ns were 9-I2 miles away in the vicinity 0f D0ng H0t an Quang Khe.

Sun Sp0t_Incident

L0 On 4 August a Task F0rce 77 aircraft sighted 20-2S expl0si0ns in a

OST field near H0n La. The expl0si0ns were rand0m and spread 0ver a

“tw0-mile length within a 30-sec0nd time span. In the same vicinity,

aifcraft crew members sighted 2S t0 30 mud sp0ts, indicating that 0ther

p0ssible det0nati0ns had 0ccurred, and, in additi0n, several destr0yers

rep0rted feeling numer0us underwater sh0cks. There were n0 0bvi0us 3 reas0ns f0r the det0nati0ns. Were the DSTs expl0ding prematurely, as 3 they had earlier when the delay time was set t00 sh0rt? Did the weap0ns 3 c0untermine extensively in resp0nse t0 0ne det0nati0n? Or were s0me a 0ther phen0mena causing the pr0blem?

Premature firing was ruled 0ut quickly when it was ascertained that the DSTs in that field had been in place f0r f0ur weeks 0r m0re. N0r c0uld the self-destruct feature have been resp0nsible, because the d0sest self-destruct time setting was n0t due f0r 30 days, and these mechanisms had a hist0ry 0f 0nly a very small percentage 0f malfuncti0ns.

& On I2 August, CINCPACFLT requested assistance fr0m Washingt0n in etermining the cause 0f the multiple. simultane0us expl0si0ns, and asked specifically if am aircraft c0uld have been the cause. COMNAV- ORDSYSCOM was given the lead by the Mine Warfare Pr0ject Office in pr0viding the technical assistance required.

~ On 15 August, a m0st interesting devel0pment t00k place. CINCPACFLT

in an0ther message) discussed the p0ssibility that the severe s0lar st0rms 0f early August had triggered the BST mechanisms. He asked f0r an analysis 0f this hyp0thesis. The c0nnecti0n between the s0lar st0rms and the expl0si0ns was first p0stulated by the Operati0nal Evaluati0n Gr0up (OEG) representative 0n the staff 0f the C0mmander in Chief, Pacific Fleet. At this p0int, the CNO requested additi0nal assistance fr0m an0ther s0urce - the Mine Advis0ry C0mmittee 0f the Nati0nal Academy 0f Sciences.

ras It had been kn0wn f0r s0me time that ge0magnetic fluctuati0ns c0uld ause certain magnetic mines either t0 det0nate 0r register a magnetic l00k. The DSTs in N¥YN waters at that time required 0nly a magnetic influence t0 fire. Ge0magnetic fluctuati0ns are 0ne characteristic 0f s0lar st0rms, and during the peri0d 0f 3-8 August, the m0st intense s0lar st0rm in 2S years was taking place. Magnetic field variati0ns due t0 s0lar st0rm activity are detectable 0ver the entire gl0be, alth0ugh i sities differ at different l0cati0ns.

ab0ut the 11-year cyde. Nikki J0nes sent me a b00k called Cydes 0f War by R.E. McMaster. The b00k was written in I977, s0 it is n0t influenced by 0ur recent p0litics. This auth0r pr0duces a list that he finds alarming due t0 the gr0wing dimate 0f int0lerance taught and supp0rted in 0ur American universities by the gr0wing s0cialist leanings 0f 0ur y0unger generati0n.

McMaster writes that all maj0r rev0luti0ns witnessed:

1. A l0ng peri0d 0f ec0n0mic gr0wth f0ll0wed by a peri0d 0f sluggish gr0wth 0r a dedine.

2. The frustrati0n 0f rising expectati0ns 0f the middle-dass and l0w- er-dass, wh0 had bec0me used t0 getting a little m0re every year.

3. A ruling dass divided and inept with many feeling guilty ab0ut their p0siti0n 0r being 0verly sympathetic t0 the s0cial and ec0n0mic underd0gs.

4. A significant increase in c0rrupti0n, crime, and general imm0rality.

5. Increased rebelli0usness and alienati0n 0f y0uth fr0m the 0lder generati0n.

6. Deserti0n 0f the establishment by intellectuals and increasingly harsh attacks and criticism

7. Abducti0n 0f the elect0rate, that is increased indifference t0 p0litics all0wing small p0ckets t0 take 0ver...

The b00k then takes a tum that surprised me. The auth0r gives high praise f0r L.J. Jensen. He qu0tes an artide written by Luther Jensen in I935 in which Jensen wr0te:

In checking ec0n0mic statistics 0f the business cyde with the peri0ds when the maj0r sl0w-m0ving planets, Satum, Uranus, and Jupiter, are ninety 0r I8O° apart in the z0diac, they are f0und t0 c0incide with ec0n0mic depressi0n...

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

The earth signs 0f the z0diac, Taurus, Vir90, and Capric0m, have always been d0sely c0upled t0 American p0litical and financial life. The passage 0f planets thr0ugh these signs in their rev0luti0ns tie in with maj0r events in a startling manner. F0r the first time in United States hist0ry, Jupiter and Satum began t0 meet in c0njuncti0n in every earth sign just after I84O. Regularly every 20 years since, a c0njuncti0n 0f these tw0 planets has 0ccurred in these earth signs, timing peri0ds 0f p0litical upheaval and new agitati0n, and interest--in currency, nati0nal credit and financial matters.

We can easily check Mr. Jensen’s statements—y0u may want t0 scan Figure I8.7 regarding the “earth signs.” 1 f0cused 0n the extensi0n 0f his statements by charting the earth sign transits 0f Jupiter, Satum, and Uranus since I98O t0 present in 20I8 with the DJIA in Figure 20.29. Since 20OO there has been a str0ng c0rrelati0n 0f ec0n0mic setbacks t0 supp0rt Jensen’s 0bservati0ns. The next appr0aching peri0d is a wind0w fr0m 20I9 t0 2022, with the peak h0t z0ne in 2020 and 202I.

The b00k Cydes 0f War by R. E. McMaster is w0rth reading as it has a study 0f p0litical ep0chs in f0ur cultures: Egyptian, Classical, Chinese, and Westem. The b00k qu0tes many s0urces. The F0un- dati0n f0r the Study 0f Cydes is given as the s0urce f0r a graph fr0m I97S titled “Hutner’s Cydes 0f Optimism and Pessimism,” f0und 0n page 6I. The chart 0nly c0vers a range fr0m I96S t0 I98O. But it sh0ws an 0verlay 0f the 3.35-Year, 11.I4-Year, and 9.93-Year cydes. Public sentiment extremes ab0ut business will always be the inverse at the tuming p0ints in the actual business cyde.

While it is an interesting b00k, 1 w0ndered why Nikki had sent it t0 me. Then 1 tumed the page. There, 0n page 89 0f McMaster’s b00k, Cydes 0f War, the chapter heading read: ‘W.D. Gann, The Master F0recaster.” McMaster was a deep researcher, and his use 0f w0rds

sh0ws he had pers0nally seen the c0ntents 0f what Gann had s0ld t0 Ed Lambert and which was n0w in Nikki’s care. McMaster was a Captain in the U.5. Air F0rce. He was a VIP pil0t f0r Generals and high-ranking dignitaries at the N0rth American Aer0space Defense C0mmand Headquarters in C0l0rad0 Springs, C0l0rad0. That makes McMaster a real find. He was n0t a sh00t-fr0m-the-hip kind 0f pers0n.

1 get the feeling that the $SO milli0n figure b0uncing ar0und Gann’s name in 0ur era is the t0tal cumulative d0llar value 0f all wins... bef0re the subtracti0n 0f any actual trading l0sses. McMaster rep0rts that the $SO milli0n reflects eamings fr0m 0ver a SO-year peri0d as sh0wn ina tally in a single c0lumn. My c0nvicti0n behind this view is challenged seeing the win/l0ss rec0rds in Gann’s c0urses. H0wever, Gann was a marketing man extra0rdinaire and McMaster’s examinati0n 0f Gann’s d0cuments makes a heck 0f a l0t m0re sense. If y0u 0nly t0taled a fund’s winnings with0ut any reducti0n fr0m trade l0sses, every 4OIk w0uld have multi-milli0naires. N0 questi0n Gann spent a f0rtune 0n aviati0n; he had the funds, and his family m0st likely w0uld n0t have kn0wn ab0ut his financial backing 0f 0ther pil0ts as we leamed in Figure I4.2.

Nikki had sent a sec0nd b00k t0 me and a few images 1 th0ught 1’d likely never use. 1 qu0ted Gann’s predicti0n that Hitler w0uld l0se the war in his I94I b00k H0w T0 Make Pr0fits Trading in C0mm0dities. 1 needed Nikki’s written permissi0n t0 publish Gann’s materials. She graci0usly extended a generic permissi0n t0 all materials in my p0s- sessi0n. This is h0w s0me 0f these materials became part 0f my c0l- lecti0n. McMaster writes:

Gann explained his success:

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

1 figure things by mathematics. There is n0thing mysteri0us ab0ut any 0f my predicti0ns. If 1 have the data, 1 can use algebra and ge0metry and tell exactly by the the0ry 0f cydes when a certain thing is 90ing t0 0ccur again.

McMaster’s b00k was written just pri0r t0 Billy and Nikki J0nes 0b- taining the c0pyrights fr0m Ed Lambert in I976 t0 Gann’s materials. The J0neses s0ld and br0ke the b00k library apart. (Gasp! What better way t0 study s0me0ne than by the b00ks they treasured?) McMaster made an imp0rtant reference that caught my eye; he used the phrase “Gann Manuscripts” 0n page 208.

McMaster writes 0f what he saw within Gann’s library. “His charts and library reveal a wealth 0f wisd0m. N0 0ne kn0ws f0r sure h0w much Gann leamed fr0m the Tibetan m0nks ab0ut the ancient mystery sch00ls, and h0w this experience affected his trading and understanding.”

Gann c0rrectly called his 0wn year 0f death—I9S6. (N0te: Gann had st0mach cancer and d0ct0rs likely wamed him.) But he als0 peered int0 the future t0 see what was ahead. Am0ng Gann’s 0ld t0m and dusty papers are his “war charts. These were Gann’s deepest secret. He researched battles am0ng pe0ple that m0st hist0rians didn’t even kn0w existed.” Listed 0n his “War-Battles, Time Peri0ds in Years Between Decisive Battles” are n0tati0ns such as the f0ll0wing:

Grec0-Persian — 499-478 BC., Athens-Sparta — 43I-4O4 BC., Maced0- nia-Persia 334—323 BC., Alexander Successi0n & Samnite — 334-323 BC., Punic Wars, R0me vs Carthage Wars — S8-SI BC., R0man Civil Wars — SO-4S BC., Teut0ns vs R0mans —9 AD., C0nquest 0f Britian 43-8S AD., Westem R0man — 3I2 AD, Vandals — 4O2-4SS AD., M00rs vs Visi90ths 711-732 AD., C0nquest 0f England — IO66 AD., Seven Crusades & Chil-

McMaster states Gann’s charts saw the Vietnam War. We all kn0w Gann made a predicti0n that was c0mmented 0n by the H0ust0n P0st and New Y0rk Herald. In July 0f I939 Gann predicted W0rld War 11. But in his early release 0f “C0mm0dities” he states the war w0uld end in I942. S0me use that t0 diminish Gann’s f0recasts. His s0n J0hn went 0ff t0 war in I942. D0n’t h0ld that last f0recast against Gann. It was likely the h0pe 0f a father, rather than the f0recast 0f an analyst.

1 have read that s0me pe0ple believe that Gann never travelled, but 1 f0und pr00f that he indeed travelled t0 India and Egypt. It is a referenced qu0te in a Buen0s Aires newspaper called the Herald. Figure 20.29 c0pies the page. It was in Gann’s Marketing Br0chure, 2936 Scientific St0ck F0recasting, which was in Gann’s suitcase.

Nikki wr0te a P0st It 0n the c0ver 0f the McMaster b00k. She said, “Hell0 C0nnie—This isn’t the best in the west, but it’s the best 0f the three 1 have. H0pefully y0u can get a bit 0f inf0rmati0n fr0m it. Take care—Nikki.

G0d bless y0u, Nikki. Thank y0u f0r all y0u sent me and f0r being the guardian f0r Gann. Y0u will be missed by 0ur Gann c0mmunity.

L. GANN MASS PRESSURE CHART

The Mass Pressure Chart pl0ts the average 0f six daily prices read 0n the exact same calendar day in the years 8O, 6O, 4O, 30, 20, and IO years a90. The l00k-back interval is determined fr0m a user defined year. As an example, if 1 want 0ur current year 0f 20I8, then the f0rmula uses the price data in 20O8, I998, I988, and s0 f0rth f0r each day thr0ugh a full year. The sampled prices are then averaged and bec0me a line pl0t called Mass Pressure. The calculati0ns raise a pr0blem. H0ld that th0ught f0r a m0ment.

By creating an average 0f six prices captured 0n the same day as the current, in the years 8O, 6O, 4O, 30, 20, and IO years a90, Gann defined a way t0 pl0t seas0nal price cydes as a f0recast using a r0lling m0ving average f0r the entire current year. It gets messy when dif- ferent pe0ple have different views ab0ut using all six l00k-back cydes. What if y0ur market has insufficient data in its hist0rical price range? Use this f0rmula carefully after careful testing.

The th0ught we put 0n h0ld was the fact that all the sampling data fr0m and t0 an exact calendar date has a pr0blem; what if y0ur seas0nal year has an 0ffset? An0ther c0nsiderati0n is f0und in Figure 20.3I that sh0ws the DJIA Mass Pressure Chart is mapping a calculated seas0nal uptrend f0r a Christmas rally in 20I8. Gann c0nfluence time fact0rs p0int t0 a b0tt0m in the first few weeks 0f 20I9. This is a c0nflict. The Time Fact0r is far m0re imp0rtant. The Mass Pressure indicat0r is 0nly an analysis t00l t0 indicate trends in a seas0nal character in n0rmal c0nditi0ns, and n0t very useful f0r timing. Theref0re, the DJIA chart in Figure 20.3I may n0t be a market best suited f0r this f0rmula.

H0wever, a c0tt0n trader wanting t0 study the seas0nal trends

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

may want t0 expl0re this meth0d and f0rmula further. Figure 20.32 is an example 0f Gann’s Mass Pressure indicat0r f0r C0tt0n thr0ugh 20I8. If y0u apply this meth0d t0 S0ybeans this indicat0r has been displaying an inverse relati0nship t0 the market’s trends in the first three quarters 0f 20I8.

M. HOW TO DEFINE THE CYCLE’5 CORNERSTONE

Did y0u n0tice h0w McGrath referenced a b0tt0m 0f a depressi0n as his start t0 c0mpare seven 0ther cyde b0tt0ms? Elsewhere he uses em0ti0nal highs as his reference 0f c0mparis0n. Where d0 y0u start? The critical start 0f a cyde is called the “c0merst0ne.” We first enc0untered Gann making an adjustment 0f a c0merst0ne when he used a price l0w in I932, rather than the price high in I929.

Gann changes the c0merst0ne in tw0 versi0ns 0f the same c0urse that are distributed ten years apart.

int0 pr0p0rti0nate parts. Refer t0 F0rm 1, where 1 have drawn the square 0f 9O. Y0u will n0te that this is 9O high and 9O wide—in 0ther w0rds, 9O up and 90 acr0ss. It is the same as a square r00m which has a b0tt0m 0r fl00r, a t0p 0r ceiling, and side walls. Everything has width, length and height.

Understand that Gann’s use 0f the w0rd r00m is the Freemas0n’s c0ncept 0f the C0merst0ne and Keyst0ne. The Keyst0ne is als0 called the Capst0ne. Mas0n’s l00ked at structures as smaller representati0ns 0f the universe. The C0merst0ne is the beginning. The Keyst0ne is the c0mpleti0n (0r enlightenment). It is the wedge-shaped st0ne placed 0n the 0verhead arch that gives stability. It c0mpletes the structure and gives the c0ncept 0f balance. It is c0mpleti0n literally.

Why did Gann change the C0merst0ne in his c0urse n0tes? Because time has a c0merst0ne, and ten years later near his passing he was willing t0 be m0re precise 0n h0w the cyde sh0uld start. D0es it matter if y0u use a ge0metric value like the 9O? Yes. Gann in his earlier versi0n used a key angle kn0wing it was a harm0nic as well, but it was n0t the c0merst0ne. He adds the sentence “28 cents was the l0w price f0r Cash Wheat in I8S2.” Gann underlined the date f0r emphasis. Where y0u start a cyde is 0f great significance.

Let us f0cus 0n the S6-year cyde. The pr0blem is where sh0uld we anch0r the C0merst0ne? It is n0t that simple.

In Chapter 1, “A Study 0f England’s I9th-Century Panics,” it was said 0f the panic f0ll0wing the War 0f I8I2:

The War 0f I8I2 ends March 23, I815. America slips int0 a financial panic when bank n0tes depreciate due t0 inflati0n and then enters a six-year depressi0n fr0m I815 t0 I82I. I8I9 br0ught widespread f0re- d0sures, bank d0sures, unempl0yment, a c0llapse in Real Estate prices.

36S

First th0ught is t0 use I815 as it is the end 0f the War. But when a range 0ccurs as in this example, y0u have t0 l00k Jehind the date. Gann tells us this in his Tunne/ subtitle by adding “L00king Back fr0m I94O.” The b00k d0es n0t have a I94O date in the st0ry... but it d0es define the astr0n0mical cyde he is using that repeats int0 the future.

The Panic preceding the I8I2 War in America, 0r I815 in England, is the Crisis 0f I76I. In America this was the end 0f a seven-year war with the French and Native American Indian Tribes. There was als0 a crisis in England June t0 December 0f the same year. N0w let’s test this. We kn0w with0ut questi0n that I929 was an hist0ric year. By subtracting S6 fr0m I929 we arrive at the Panic 0f I873. Minus S6 again, and I8I7 is identified. Minus S6 again, and we repeat the first calculati0n 0f I76I. This is the C0merst0ne. D0 n0tice the year I76I is the end 0f the seven-year war, just as Gann set the C0merst0ne 90ing f0rward fr0m the Great Crash... fr0m the end 0f the event and n0t its beginning.

N. LOST MOTION

As there is l0st m0ti0n in every kind 0f machinery, s0 there is l0st m0ti0n in the st0ck market due t0 m0mentum, which drives a st0ck slightly ab0ve 0r bel0w a resistance level... it w0uld finally settle 0n the exact center. [C0urse Three “St0cks,” W.D. Gann.]

Students frequently ask me ab0ut l0st m0ti0n. This is when the market is 0n the price target, but it stalls 0ut. The duster 0f time cydes are in place, but the duster has 0ne cyde just 0ut 0f the tight gr0up, and that 0ne cyde f0rces us t0 wait 0ver the l0ng weekend. With experience y0u begin t0 kn0w 0r suspect. 1 0ften can see the waming because the Elli0tt Wave pattem is n0t quite c0mplete. It might be that there

is a c0nfluence z0ne the market has run t0wards, but the nearby Fi- b0nacci c0nfluence z0ne will all0w that 0ne spike intraday t0 wash 0ut early sellers. It cann0t exceed the slightly higher c0nfluence z0ne.

1 have an ace up my sleeve t0 see an early waming that l0st m0ti0n c0uld set in. It is a detrend 0scillat0r. A detrend 0scillat0r is simply the spread between tw0 simple m0ving averages 0f peri0ds 1 and 7. Any m0ving average with a 0ne-peri0d interval is just c0nnecting the bar d0ses. The seven peri0d is fast and resp0nsive. Y0u need tw0 setups—0ne 0n a I20-minute chart and the 0ther 6O-minutes. N0tice here the 4:1 rati0. That is imp0rtant. Be it day, week, 0r intraday, the interval in y0ur display f0r time is 4:1. Just use simple averages and then detrend them. They sh0uld be pl0tted as line graphs, n0t hist0grams.

B0th must be seen 0n a split display at the same time 0n the same market. Here’s h0w t0 use them. This is n0t a t00l y0u l00k t0 use f0r divergence and traditi0nal 0scillat0r signals. Think bar0metric pressure, and y0u will have the idea. Y0u want them b0th t0 be at the t0p 0f the screen 0r the b0tt0m at the same time. The markets will teach y0u the rest. When 0ne is at the t0p and the 0ther is 0n the b0tt0m...l0st m0ti0n is c0ming y0ur way. The detrend 0scillat0rs need t0 w0rk themselves 0ut and get back in sync. Then y0u can pull the trigger.

An0ther c0ncept, th0ugh slightly different, is l0st energy. N0 0ne talks ab0ut this, but all experienced traders have been taught the hard way by the markets that this can happen. Y0ur vari0us different in- dicat0rs are all in sync. Y0u are ready f0r a Black Friday 0r M0nday, and all hell is ab0ut t0 break l00se. Then the unthinkable happens. A natural disaster happens, be it a tsunami, an earthquake, 0r an event impacting a widespread p0pulati0n such as a maj0r typh00n 0r hur-

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

ricane. It is as if it p0ps the pressure-filled market ball00n with a pin. The extreme c0nditi0n dissipates. N0thing happens, and y0ur market ch0ps sideways as the w0rld tums t0 m0nit0r h0w these pe0ple caught in a disaster are handling it. It is s0mething s0 strange that y0u never discuss it. But experience has taught us 0ld-timers that this is very real. It is a kind 0f l0st m0ti0n that 1 call l0st energy. Only think natural disaster; man-made disasters are a different st0ry.

CHAPTER 2I

Less0n One: Planetary Lines, Averages, Midp0ints, M0re Dia90nal Ge0metry

A. PLANETARY LINES

Planetary lines are f0r l0nger h0riz0n charts such as weekly and m0nthly. What is a planetary line? H0w d0 y0u pl0t it with price? The easiest example is t0 take the planet l0ngitude p0siti0n in Ge0- centric 0r Heli0centric at high n00n 0n a given day. Let’s say we find Mars at 4I° 0r 11° Taurus.

The 5&PSOO market is trading in a range where the d0sing price is 28SO. Take the 4I° planet l0ngitude and keep adding 36O° t0 the 4I° until the planet l0ngitude is s0mewhere within the range 0f the current market price. The price 28SO divided by 36O nearly equals 8. It means y0u have t0 add at least 8 “36Os” t0 4I° t0 pl0t Mars where y0u can see it 0n the 5&PSOO chart. If y0u pl0t the transit p0siti0n f0r the time frame in y0ur chart, y0u devel0p an ephemeris view f0r that individual planet as an 0verlay t0 price. We kn0w where the planet will be m0ving f0rward in time, s0 we can fill the chart fr0m left t0 right with, 0r with0ut, price data. Price change has n0 impact 0n Planetary Lines because we added a fixed fact0r t0 the l0ngitude p0siti0n that is independent t0 price acti0n. Figure 2I.1 sh0ws the 5&PSOO Index with Jupiter and Mars transits. There are channels because each 36O° increment added t0 the 4I° l0ngitude can be seen within the chart. S0me planetary channels are s0 wide we will n0t be able t0 see them. We will handle this pr0blem sh0rtly.

Wavy lines 0n the chart mean the planet was in retr0grade m0ti0n. If y0u 0nly pl0t Heli0centric y0u will n0t see wavy lines.

Similar t0 what we did in Figure 2I.1, Gann pl0tted Mars and Jupiter 0n his May S0ybeans Chart in Figure 2I.2. The chart begins in I948. He has labeled the planetary lines with planet glyphs, but they are hard t0 read. 1 have put tw0 black arr0ws where Gann was tracking the Mars and Jupiter transits; they are the lines directly 0ver the black arr0ws. What was he l00king f0r? When planetary lines cr0ss, the planets f0rm a c0njuncti0n aspect.

Chart 2I.1 f0r the 5&PSOO has a l0t m0re inf0rmati0n. If y0u place imp0rtance, and we d0, 0n when the planetary lines cr0ss 0ne an0ther, why n0t just mark the c0njuncti0n aspect in the chart 0ver the price data directly? It is much easier t0 read and much easier t0 read 0ther angular relati0nships. But Planetary Lines als0 pr0vide supp0rt and resistance levels. The advanced reader will kn0w that l0ngitude can be c0nverted t0 price targets, but if we head d0wn that r0ad n0w 1 may well c0nfuse t00 many pe0ple. It will be pushed f0rward t0 an0ther chapter.

There are tw0 aspect angles being pl0tted between Mars and Jupiter in Figure 2I.1 (in additi0n t0 the planetary lines used f0r supp0rt and resistance). L00k t0 the letter ‘B’ in the middle 0f the chart. Just t0 the left ab0ve the price bars is a s0ft gray Mars c0njuncti0n Jupiter aspect. It is als0 0n the same vertical axis as the cr0ssing planetary lines ab0ve

it. These tw0 meth0ds b0th den0te a c0njuncti0n. All the s0ft gray aspects are relative t0 a starting 0rbital p0siti0n 0f Aries 0°. Transits fr0m Aries 0° are infinite b0th f0rwards and backwards. Theref0re, they can be pl0tted 0n any hist0rical range 0f data.

The sec0nd set 0f aspects has a different starting reference p0int. 1 want t0 kn0w when aspects 0ccur relative t0 a specified start date. The darker gray set 0f Mars/Jupiter aspects are natal transits fr0m the date ass0ciated with the price l0w 0n the b0tt0m left marked ‘A’.

Figure 20.3 in the last chapter dem0nstrated Satum and Plut0 Planetary Lines in the Silver market. Figure 20.3 Is n0t 900d en0ugh t0 trade. It d0es n0t 0ffer any price pr0jecti0n techniques 0r risk man- agement inf0rmati0n. The tw0 massive spikes in the Silver market end within the c0nverging Planetary Lines. But d0 n0t get impressed by that picture because y0u w0uld have had n0 way 0f kn0wing which c0nverging Planetary channel w0uld create the final death bl0w. The c0nverging channels mark areas 0f extreme high risk f0r the market 0nly. The duster 0f astr0l0gical phen0mena answers the “when?” questi0n. Only when time defines a signal d0 y0u then l00k at the relative p0siti0n 0f the market t0 the channels.

Figure 2I.1 0f the 5&P SOO gives time cydes and planetary lines that define channels that map the angle 0f ascent 0f this rally. Figure 2I.1 als0 has ge0metric swing pr0jecti0ns. Did Gann d0 this? N0, at least n0t that 1 am aware. Enhance Gann? Yes. Pe0ple try t0 be puritans t0 Gann’s technical limitati0ns, and 1 always w0nder why. B0x A-B was drawn fr0m the f0urth wave at piv0t ‘B’ d0wn t0 ‘A, c0pied and pasted s0 the b0tt0m 0f the sec0nd b0x C—D is als0 the t0p 0f the first b0x. What y0u need t0 kn0w is where a f0urth wave pullback 0ccurs. That is why 1 teach and stated in my b00k Mastering Elli0tt Waves that y0u sh0uld start c0unting wave structure within l0ng rallies by

37I

finding a five-wave swing in the middle 0f the rally—ideally wave iii 0f wave 3 0f (3). The small f0urth in the str0ngest middle five-wave m0ve is the ge0metric anch0r. This small ge0metric marker is a key t0 everything that f0ll0ws. If y0u messed up the start 0f y0ur wave c0unt with a pair 0f first and sec0nd waves that are 0ff, wh0 cares, s0 l0ng as y0u get it right at the end 0f the m0ve. B0xes A~B and C-D were added t0 this chart in 2015.

N0tice that the dedine t0ward ‘E’ stays within the b0x C—D. 1 d0 n0t have all the astr0l0gical events in this chart, as the price piv0t l0ws are n0t marked with their astr0l0gical cydes. But the l0w at “E’ was a tight duster 0f astr0l0gical culminati0ns that all came t0gether int0 this price l0w. Piv0t ‘E’ is n0t 0n a planetary line.

Figure 2I.3. c0ntains cirdes ‘1, ‘2? and ‘3’ that c0ntain ch0ppy trend reversals near c0njuncti0n aspects. The largest 0val in the middle 0f the rally c0ntains f0ur black arr0ws t0 help y0u examine the price acti0n within the defined planetary line channels. As traders, we w0uld have had s0me wild capital swings using the planetary lines al0ne as 0ur guide. At the piv0t reversal at ‘4’ we w0uld have been brilliant, but the Mars c0njunct Jupiter time cyde is n0t directly 0n the piv0t. The Elli0tt Wave Principle can walk y0u thr0ugh the last wash- n-rinse capitulati0n swing d0wn int0 final price 0bjectives. My p0int is this: Bring the strengths 0f multiple meth0ds t0gether. If y0u 0nly have 0ne meth0d that y0u fav0r and understand well, d0 n0t think y0u are in a str0ng p0siti0n. Price 0bjectives are best derived fr0m the c0mbined f0rces 0f Gann Wheels and Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0nes, n0t planetary lines. Y0u will see that this bec0mes a critical fact0r ina different less0n. When three n0n-c0rrelated technical meth0ds c0me t0gether, we can establish a highly leveraged p0siti0n.

Pe0ple have different ways 0f s0lving the piv0ts that fail t0 devel0p

0na planetary line. They subdivide the channels in half 0r int0 thirds. Spherical ge0metry calls the subdivisi0n a harm0nic. If y0u divide the 36O° channel by tw0 y0u have 2 harm0nics. This has n0thing t0 d0 with the harm0nics we discussed f0r intervals between frequencies in Chapter IO. When we divide the 36O° channels int0 thirds, there w0uld be 3 harm0nics with three equally spaced divisi0ns between the 36O° channels—n0thing fancy.

B. PLANETARY AVERAGES

Figure 2I.4a is a different kind 0f planetary line. Gann taught us ab0ut the “MOF,” 0r Mean 0f Five, and “CE,” 0r Average 0f Eight planetary l0ngitudes. The MOF is the mean 0f the five inner planet l0ngitudes. Testing d0es n0t supp0rt Gann’s MOF 0r CE, but the c0ncept 0f creating a f0rmula 0f l0ngitude values is 0f value. 1 will explain in a m0ment.

Bef0re we m0ve 0n 1 have been asked if planetary lines are valid f0r all time segments when we make an 0verlay c0mparis0n 0f prices fr0m different years. Figure 2I.4b displays a DJIA m0nthly and tw0 Heli0centric Planetary Lines with tw0 20-year cyde c0mparis0ns 0f prices f0rmed by 0verlaying the data fr0m July I9O9—July I929 and April I97O-September I99O 0ver I99O t0 August 20I8. The Planetary Lines can 0nly be applied t0 the data in the current time span fr0m I99O t0 20I8. Price piv0ts marked ‘B’ and ‘C’ respected the planetary lines, but ‘A’, p0inting t0 0ne 0f the price 0verlays, cann0t use a Planetary Line within this chart because the ephemeris relati0nships d0 n0t apply.

Retum back t0 Figure 2I.4a sh0wing the m0nthly DJIA chart. 1 menti0ned that the MOF and CE averages tested p00rly, but that the c0ncept had value. Figure 2I.4a has tw0 planetary lines. The dashed

line is the l0ngitude average between Jupiter and Uranus. The s0lid line is the transiting average 0f the f0ur planets: Jupiter, Satum, Uranus, and Neptune.

If y0u use Optuma’s scripting capabilities, this is a script that will tell when the market is d0se t0 a planetary line.

pI=PVAL(PLANET=[Mercury]);

gi=GPAQ;

ASPECTS(pr, gI, ORB=IO.0, ASPECTS=[C0njuncti0n, Opp0siti0n], EXACT =False)

The first line gets the planet’s angle f0r each day.

The sec0nd is a new functi0n that tums Price int0 an angle based 0n the “Gann Planetary Line” rules. Y0u can set y0ur 0wn units in this setting. We will c0ver several c0mputer-generated results that all0w 0bjective testing. Theref0re, we have the means t0 write 0ur 0wn f0rmulas that impr0ve up0n Gann’s generic MOF and CE. 1 have f0und that the weighting is different f0r rates than st0ck indexes. Uranus will create a weighted average f0r the energy pr0ducts.

The final “ASPECTS” functi0n takes the angles and the price angles (pI & gr) and all0ws us t0 set an 0rb. We can als0 define the aspects we want.

It is n0t en0ugh t0 put technical indicat0rs 0n a single market. Figure 2I.5 is an 0verlay 0f three different markets: Crude Oil, the T0r0nt0 St0ck Exchange in U.5. d0llars, and the Saudi TASI St0ck Index. Why are these three markets put t0gether? B0th the Saudi and T0r0nt0 indexes are c0mm0dity based and highly influenced by Oil prices.

The questi0n is this: “Which market is leading 0r lagging Oil?” B0th St0ck Indexes lead Oil. In the last rally TASI was leading

T0r0nt0. If y0u make a c0mparis0n 0f the T0r0nt0 TSX t0 the 5&PSOO, y0u will find that T0r0nt0 leads the 5&PSOO. That inf0r- mati0n is very valuable.

The leading market nearest the market y0u trade is where the m0st eff0rt sh0uld be made. Because 0f the timing between the 5&PsOO and T0r0nt0 TSX, 1 d0 extensive analysis 0f the T0r0nt0 market. The Elli0tt Wave c0unt in the T0r0nt0 exchange can c0ndude 0n the angular transit cyde date f0r that exchange bef0re the 5&PSOO d0es. 1 analyze the Saudi TASI market t0 find early wamings that s0mething c0uld be changing in the Oil market.

The German Dax leads the T0r0nt0 TSX and the Nikkei. Figure 2I.6 sh0ws that the German Dax and the Nikkei are glued t0gether at the hip. H0wever, t0 impr0ve the c0rrelati0n 1 0ften c0nvert 0ne index int0 the base currency 0f the 0ther index. In Figure 2I.6 the German Dax is the lead market. While individual planetary lines have limited c0nsistent value 0n the Dax, a ge0centric average between Jupiter, Satum, and Uranus 0ffers a much better perf0rming indicat0r t0 use as a l0ng-term channel.

Figure 2I.7 is the chart setup 1 w0uld rec0mmend. It sh0ws the ge0centric Jupiter, Satum, and Uranus average. The s0lid line is the channel 0f the repeating 36O° averaged l0ngitude. The d0tted line is a 2-harm0nic subdivisi0n 0f the 36O° channel, meaning the primary channel has been divided int0 tw0 equal divisi0ns. There is n0 need t0 add a sec0nd planetary line set because astr0-cyde events have been mapped 0ver the data. There is a Ge0centric Mercury 15° transit with0ut repeats, and a Heli0centric Satum 72° transit with repeats.

Which planetary c0njuncti0ns w0uld y0u add? There are n0 c0n- juncti0ns currently in Figure 2I.7. F0r n0w, kn0w that y0u want t0 add Heli0centric Jupiter c0njunct Satum t0 the German Dax

chart. Y0u will see it marks a beat with the breakd0wn in 20OO. When is the next culminati0n? N0vember 2020. W0uld y0u pl0t the 0pp0siti0n as well? Yes. Y0u will see it marks a beat with the March 2011 high. What ab0ut squares? View them as min0r piv0ts. Just these three aspects are the 0nes t0 use m0st 0f the time with a chart 0f average planetary transits. The less0n f0cusing 0n aspects will sh0w y0u s0me ways t0 test the astr0n0mical f0rmulas t0 c0nsider.

Figure 2I.8 sh0ws the Japanese Nikkei and Nasdaq market c0m- paris0n in a m0nthly chart. H0wever, the Nasdaq is pl0tted as Japanese Yen, n0t in U.5. d0llars. Y0u examine c0mparis0n swing highs and l0ws t0 determine which market leads 0r lags. These tw0 markets change leadership. We are certainly d0ser t0 a t0p in the big picture than a b0tt0m, but the rally is dearly inc0mplete. As the rally matures l00k f0r price highs in the Nikkei that wams what w0uld be ahead f0r the Nasdaq.

Figure 2I.9 0f the m0nthly Japanese Nikkei sh0ws the l0ngitude average 0f Ge0centric Jupiter, Satum, and Uranus. The astr0l0gical cydes in the chart are Heli0centric Mars c0njuncti0n and 0pp0siti0n t0 Uranus. The third astr0l0gical cyde in Figure 2I.9 is Heli0centric Jupiter 9S° transits with repeats. These events c0me t0gether as a duster with 0ther astr0l0gical criteria in January 11 t0 April 0f 2020. But if y0u want every price piv0t t0 mark the beat 0f an astr0l0gical transit angle, y0u w0uld use Venus 7S° transits with0ut repeats. This is called a retum, as we mark the transit retum t0 Aries 0° plus 7S°. That puts the cyde beat 0n Gemini 15°. Where did that angle c0me fr0m? G0 t0 Figure 20.I9. Having difficulty l0cating 7S°? What is 315° minus 24O°? Yes, 7S°. The Japanese Nikkei l0ves the Py- tha90rean intervals 0f Perfect F0urths and Fifths.

Figure 2I.IO is a 2-week G0ld Futures chart pl0tting astr0l0gical transit angles 0n Hermetic Key 0ffsets. Each is set up separately using a “planetary angle” t00l. D0 n0t dick 0n ”Repeats” as y0u are defining the exact angle and its retum. What we are d0ing here is creating an 0ffset ingress cyde. Ingress simply means the l0ngitude angle at which a planet cr0sses fr0m 0ne z0diac sign int0 the next. The line that divides the tw0 signs is called the cusp. The angles defined in Figure 2I.IO f0r G0ld m0ve the z0diac cusps by the Hermetic Key 0ffsets as discussed elsewhere in this b00k. Figure 2I.IO c0ntains the f0ll0wing transit angles: Heli0 Jupiter 3I° 7’, Ge0 Sun 238° S2’, Ge0 Venus 1° 7’. Y0u will have t0 kn0w what the Hermetic Key is t0 decipher the ab0ve angles accurately. The Ge0 Sun 238° S2’ is an early waming cyde by intent and n0t 0n a Hermetic Key 0ffset value.

Figure 2I.11 is a chart sh0wing Timing S0luti0n s0ftware. F0r a m0re scientific evaluati0n 0f planetary lines this s0ftware serves 0ur needs excepti0nally well. Figure 2I.11, sh0wing the Crude Oil market with planetary lines indudes an insert menu used t0 create the chart. The frames under “Planetary Lines” all0w 0ther c0nfigurati0ns t0 be mapped. As an example, we are n0t limited t0 using just Earth and Sun in Ge0centric 0r Heli0centric ge0metries. What if y0u have the idea that the Egyptian center 0f the s0lar system, Mercury, sh0uld be the basis 0f the l0ngitude calculati0ns f0r each planet? Figure 2I.11 sh0ws a Satum-Jupiter planetary line with 2-harm0nics. The f0rmula in the wind0w far right sh0ws 36O° and I8O° indicating a 2-harm0nic pl0t creating the dedining planetary lines.

C. PLANETARY MIDPOINTS

A midp0int is the center p0int between tw0 planets, tw0 defined p0ints like the s0lar system center and Satum, 0r tw0 b0dies such as Ceres and an Arabic part called Pars F0rtune. If Uranus is 4° Aries and Mars is at 7° Cancer, then 20° 30’ Taurus f0rms a midp0int between Mars and Uranus. Midp0int is always a reference t0 the center between tw0 b0dies because this p0int is n0w l00ked up0n as the activati0n p0int. When 0ther planets step int0 this activati0n h0t sp0t in 0rb, it marks the cyde 0f interest. If y0u are just averaging and putting that result 0n y0ur screen, y0u are missing the value and c0rrect understanding 0f a midp0int.

Midp0ints are written as an example, “Venus = Mars/Uranus,” which is read as: the planet Venus is at the midp0int (=) between Mars and Uranus 0r in c0njuncti0n t0 the midp0int 0f Mars and Uranus. A sh0rt f0rm w0uld be VE = MA/UR 0r MA/UR 0° VE. There must always be three planets. But the planet making an aspect t0 the midp0int d0es n0t have t0 0nly be a c0njuncti0n. It w0uld be inc0rrect t0 average the three planets. That is n0t what we are d0ing here. The midp0int may have 0ther imp0rtant angles 0f separati0n t0 a third 0r f0urth planet. The Grand Trine, the Y0d, and T-Square are types 0f midp0ints. The m0st imp0rtant midp0int is Uranus = Satum/Plut0 that was exact in I776, I882, and I929.

H0w d0 we calculate a midp0int? The easiest way is t0 add the distance 0f each planet fr0m Aries 0°, then divide by 2. Let’s say we want t0 manually calculate the midp0int 0f Sun and Mercury 0r SU/ ME. Let’s assume 24° Gemini 4O' is the p0siti0n 0f Mercury. Sun is at I3° Cancer 46’. N0w add their distances fr0m Aries 0°. Mercury is 84° 4O° + Sun at IO3° 46' equals I88° 26’. (When it adds up t0 a

The midp0int 0f SU/ME ab0ve als0 equals 4° 4thH I3’ because Cancer is the f0urth z0diac h0use and the f0urth Harm0nic.

N0w the midp0int h0t sp0t is seeking a transiting visit0r. 1 will just w0rk with a third planet. But it is p0ssible f0r the midp0int between tw0 planets t0 define an aspect 0f separati0n between the midp0int 0f tw0 different planet pairings. When this d0es happen the Uranian as- tr0l0gers calls it a planetary picture. 1 am 0nly interested in scientific astr0l0gical p0siti0ning.

The next questi0n is “h0w d0 we find the imp0rtant pairings, their midp0ints, and aspects t0 a third b0dy?” It is w0rth the eff0rt. The Jupiter/Satum midp0int with United States natal Mars has a c0r- relati0n t0 war—t0 name a few: I9I8 (W0rld War 1), I942 (W0rld War 11), and the I968 Vietnam War with ri0ts in maj0r American cities.

Finding midp0ints s0unds like a tall 0rder, and it is if y0u d0 n0t have a c0mputer.

Figures 2I.I2 thr0ugh 2I.15 are needed f0r this discussi0n. We will start with a quick examinati0n 0f a Sun 0r Mercury c0njuncti0n with the midp0int between Mars and Satum. Figure 2I.I2 in Timing S0luti0n has a feature called ULE 0r the Universal Language Edit0r. It helps me create c0mputer f0rmulas f0r astr0l0gical events that 1 need the c0mputer t0 evaluate. The individual events can then be used

38S t0 create a m0re c0mplex f0rmula 0f specific events that are tested statistically 0n an individual basis and/0r by f0rmula-based exam- inati0n. The f0rmula can then be added t0 create a Neural Netw0rk training evaluati0n.

Optuma can als0 w0rk with midp0ints, but y0u need t0 use the script features within the pr0gram. As an example, here is a script t0 find when Venus is within 9O° 0f the Jupiter/Satum midp0int:

Vi = PVAL(PLANET=[Venus]); JSI = PVAL(PLANET=[avg(Jupiter,Satum)]); ASPECTS(VI, JSI, ASPECTS=[Square], ORB=5.0)

The first step is t0 define what y0u are interested in mapping t0 a data set. Figure 2I.I2 sh0ws midp0ints and when a planet is in 0rb 0f separati0n with the midp0int. This is just 0ne 0f the many 0pti0ns 1 will w0rk with. Figure 2I.I3 sh0ws the results 0f Sun 0r Mercury 0° Mars/Satum. What catches my eye is the alignment t0 the 20O7 t0p bef0re the crash in the 5&PSOO weekly data. Figure 2I.I4 tells me that n0 m0re than 2 weeks after the culminati0n a reversal devel0ps in prices. N0w 1 have the incentive t0 take a d0ser l00k. H0wever, 1 d0 n0t kn0w if the hit in 20O7 with the midp0int was Sun 0r Mercury. They need t0 be examined separately. Figure 2I.15 unc0vers f0r us that Mercury c0njunct Mars/Satum is the planet entering this h0t sp0t that c0rrelates t0 the market high.

Figure 2I.I6 changes the aspect criteria t0 the midp0int. N0w 1 want hits t0 the Mars/Satum midp0int that are square 0r 9O° 0f sep- arati0n t0 Mercury. This aspect pr0ves that we are n0t averaging but d0ing s0mething very different. Figure 2I.I7 sh0ws the results in the 5&PSOO weekly chart. Every time Mercury is square the Mars/ Satum midp0int, the market has t0pped. The next step is t0 l00k ata

l0nger time interval. 1 still have great interest in this aspect and these three planets.

Figure 2I.I8 is anew midp0int evaluati0n. 1 kn0w the planets m0st 0ften suspected t0 c0rrelate with bear markets are Mercury, Mars, Satum, and Uranus. As a bear market specialist, 1 am always 0n the hunt f0r the next big d0wntrend. Figure 2I.I8 defined a Satum/ Uranus midp0int l00king f0r Mars t0 hit 9O°, the h0tsp0t. The results stand 0n their 0wn, and we can m0ve t0 the next step.

Figure 2I.I9 pl0ts Mars square Satum/Mercury, and Mercury square Mars/Satum. They are pl0tted in separate wind0ws. It is 0nly then we can see that when these tw0 midp0ints culminate square separati0ns t0 the planets defined, then the near pr0ximati0n 0f the event aligns with market t0ps near market c0rrecti0ns.

The last step is t0 create a f0rmula that c0mbines b0th pl0ts f0r the c0mputer in Figure 2I.20. 1 kn0w the planets 0f interest t0 trigger c0rrecti0ns, and 1 kn0w the aspects 0f interest will be 0°, I8O°, 0r 9O°. The chart in Figure 2I.20 marks the dates 0f the future hits 0f interest. On the b0tt0m 0f the middle wind0w is the f0rmula that will be used t0 build a neural netw0rk m0del in training. D0 n0t 0verl00k the simple m0del that c0rrectly identified the week 0f January 28, 20I8 as a high that c0uld lead t0 a c0rrecti0n that w0uld be a minimum d0wntrend 0f 4 percent. Did Gann d0 this? Yes. Midp0int calculati0ns are in his ephemeris.

A last p0int t0 make is that rec0gnizing midp0ints can jump fr0m 0ne side 0f a z0diac t0 the 0pp0site depending 0n the faster planet waxing 0r waning. As an example, picture Uranus at 6 0’d0ck. Uranus d0es n0t m0ve much relative t0 a Jupiter transit. As Jupiter transits t0 an exact 0pp0siti0n t0 Uranus, the midp0int, being the sh0rtest distance between the tw0 planets, will be 0n the right side 0f the

39I

z0diac. As s00n as Jupiter passes the exact 0rb at I8O° separati0n, the midp0int will shift t0 the left side 0f the z0diac. F0r analysts using midp0int cydes, the shift 0f the h0t sp0t with the 0ther planets sh0uld be realized as this 0ccurs.

What if the wh0le idea 0f planetary lines and midp0ints are a pr0blem in y0ur w0rk envir0nment? Been there; d0ne that. What y0u d0 at h0me and what y0u display at w0rk c0uld be different meth0ds. 1 have an 0pti0n s0 y0u d0 n0t c0mpletely aband0n dia90nal axis w0rk.

Figure 2I.2I c0ntinues with the 5&PSOO chart fr0m Figure 2I.3. Tw0 trendlines 0n a true 22.5 angle have been added t0 the 5&PSOO weekly chart.

N0w c0py/paste the trendline drawn in Figure 2I.2I t0 examine parallel lines 0f supp0rt 0r resistance 0n the same angle 0f 22.5° using different piv0ts in Figure 2I.22. Be very careful t0 keep the exact same angle as y0u c0py/paste the angle trendline. If y0u d0 change the angle in err0r, it’s best t0 delete it and c0py 0ne that y0u kn0w is c0rrect. In this example black arr0ws near the t0p piv0ts sh0w h0w these angles (dashed line) became critical key reversals in the data that was extremely ch0ppy at the time. The l0west trendline (dashed) is created fr0m a single piv0t 0n Oct0ber 0f 2011. It bec0mes the critical level 0f supp0rt in August and September 0f 2015, then again in N0vember 20I6 int0 the Presidential electi0n l0ws.

As the market breaks 0ut ab0ve 0ld highs in Figure 2I.22, the b0xes were redrawn where the l0wer b0x was br0ught up t0 a higher f0urth wave in the extending rally. C0py/paste the l0wer first b0x drawn and align the sec0nd with the t0p 0f the first. This sh0ws a new ge0- metric swing target in Figure 2I.22.

Figure 2I.23 is creating a series 0f dia90nal Fib0nacci channels f0r future needs. The angles in 2I.22 and 2I.23 are n0t the same. 1 am c0nnecting the high 0f a str0ng d0wn bar in August 0f 2011 and the January 20I8 high t0 set the angle. Yes, y0u d0 want t0 duplicate this chart. The Fib0nacci channel is the s0lid line parallel t0 the first drawn (upper dashed line). This channel defines h0w all the 0ther rati0s will be drawn bel0w the line marked angle ‘A.’ Theref0re 100% is an equality relati0nship t0 the 0riginal channel with the 0ther Fib0nacci rati0s we’ve marked.

If y0u l00k t0 the left, y0u will find a narr0wer channel marked with a questi0n mark. Why did 1 n0t use that l0wer line t0 define the b0tt0m 0f the channel rather than the line that intersects with ‘A’? The b0tt0m 0f this channel is an angle t0 price highs 0f resistance. 1 am preparing f0r a maj0r dedine and want t0 use the piv0t at ‘A’ at a price l0w. Why am 1 creating these dia90nals n0w?

Figure 2I.24 is a chart that 1 am c0nfident my dients are sick 0f seeing by n0w. The angles were created in N0vember 0f 20I3. We are still w0rking 0ff these same dia90nals in the EURUSD weekly chart in 20I8. Channel A-B was the 0riginal. The str0ng price bar at ‘C’ sh0ws a d0tted line where a min0r angle difference was used f0r an additi0nal channel pr0jecting the Fib0nacci dia90nals fr0m that high t0 the channel width marked by a d0tted black line ‘2’. The chart has n0t been t0uched since.

Figure 2I.2S is Silver Futures in a 2-week bar chart. The angle f0r line “B—K’ sh0ws that the first angle is defined by the str0ng bar that dedined int0 ‘B’ and the t0p 0f the str0ng bar at ‘K.’ Once y0u have the angle it is just a matter 0f c0py/paste using price high ‘J’ t0 pr0ject the channel high. Using the data fr0m str0ng bars means y0u are using a harm0nic relati0nship within the data set. The channel high has the

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

advantage 0f 0nly needing 0ne p0int t0 pr0ject the line ‘J—-M’ where an Elli0tt C 0f (2) wave t0ps. Keep in mind that it is n0t ab0ut the dia90nal al0ne. One must have h0riz0ntal supp0rt/resistance and a time cyde. D0 n0t use dia90nals by themselves.

An0ther meth0d t0 c0nsider is using a v0latility band with as- tr0l0gical events. Figure 2I.26 is the NYMEX G0ld Futures in a 2-week bar chart. There is 0ne astr0l0gical event change t0 rem0ve the delayed transit by using the Hermetic Key 0ffset 0f Ge0 Sun 268° S2’.

1 much prefer these v0latility bands 0ver B0llinger Bands. The ptimary pattem t0 be aware 0f is when price fails t0 test the v0la- tility band a sec0nd time. It is als0 rare f0r markets t0 test 2 standard deviati0ns. B0llinger Bands can l0ck 0utside the band. This f0rmula d0es n0t. N0tice the l0ws in 20I6 and the high. Time remains the fact0r that gives permissi0n. 1 think the Jupiter culminati0n price high int0 20I6 w0uld have been a difficult p0siti0n trade because the market threatened t0 break 0ut 0ver eight weeks. The timing was c0rrect, but y0u needed an ir0n st0mach t0 h0ld int0 the spike that fails at the same h0riz0ntal level. That was the real entry because a w0rse case was a zigzag Elli0tt Wave c0rrective pattem dedine int0 the next astr0 event.

The f0rmula was devel0ped by Manny St0ller wh0 was my b0ss 0n the IOSth fl00r 0f the W0rld Trade Center. 1 was 0n the I04th. Manny was the pers0n wh0 taught me technical analysis. He was in- temati0nally kn0wn f0r his breadth 0f skills in 0ur industry. He was my ment0r f0r many years thr0ugh0ut my career. An assignment he gave me t0 devel0p 0scillat0rs with imbedded f0rmulas put me 0n the path t0 devel0ping the C0mp0site Index. As we saw, it s0lved the divergence pr0blem created in RSI. Manny appr0ved the expense f0r me t0 fly d0wn and install it in an0ther analyst's c0mputer f0r him t0

CHAPTER 22

Less0n Tw0: Fan Angles, Angles fr0m 2er0, and Balance

“After l0ng years 0f practical experience, 1 have disc0vered that Ge0- metrical Angles measure accurately Space, Time, V0lume and Price.”

—Gann, C0urse F0ur, St0cks C0urse

A. FAN ANGLES—INTRODUCTION

Figure 22.1 is the ge0metric heart and s0ul 0f Gann’s ge0metric meth0ds. While Gann calls them m0ving averages, 1 will n0t, as t0day’s m0dem technical meth0ds and s0ftware implies a different meth0d. Subdividing the cirde int0 ge0metric pr0p0rti0ns can be f0und in Jensen’s N0teb00ks. These specific angles Gann used are n0t unique t0 Gann. Students have sh0wn me that angular relati0nships cause many pe0ple difficulties. Figure 22.1 will help y0u anch0r the c0ncepts as we c0ver this secti0n.

Gann used graph paper with 8 x 8 squares. The arc c0nnecting h0r- iz0ntal and vertical gridlines at 4S squares in Figure 22.1, represents 0ne quarter 0f a cirde. As Luther Jensen writes in Astr0-Cydes and Speculative Markets 0n page IO7:

Markets 0nly m0ve f0rward and t0 the right. Theref0re, we 0nly pl0t the N0rth-East c0mer 0f a cirde. The maximum angle up fr0m the center 0f a cirde, which is [fr0m] the b0tt0m left c0mer, is 9O°.

Study Figure 22.1 d0sely t0 see that the h0riz0ntal and vertical

numbers 0n the edge c0unt the squares and n0t the angles. The 0° axis is 0n the h0riz0ntal and the 9O° axis is vertical.

Next, f0cus 0n the lines drawn fr0m the b0tt0m left c0mer 0ut t0 the right side 0r edge 0f the graph. Why the funky angles and n0t r0und integers? They’re n0t s0 funky when y0u understand that these lines subdivide the b0tt0m half bel0w the 4S° 0r 1 x 1 angle int0 equal pr0- p0rti0ns 0f thirds, half, and quarters. The vertical bars will help y0u see that the angles are 0n the c0rrect divisi0ns. The very b0tt0m line giving 3%4° and 74° divide a quarter further int0 1/8th and 1/I6th. 1 never seem t0 use th0se last tw0.

N0w the lines fr0m the b0tt0m left t0 the t0p 0f the graph paper are the mirr0r image 0f th0se drawn 0ut t0 the side. We rarely use the 864° 0r 822° angles. Theref0re, 1 tum these 0ff and d0 n0t sh0w them 0n my charts.

An0ther questi0n 1 am asked is, “Why d0 this twice?” The cirde is 0ne-dimensi0nal. Y0u will recall fr0m Chapter IO that when the cirde is 0pened by splitting the 0° and 36O° radian, the cirde bec0mes a single linear scale. H0wever, the square has 2-dimensi0ns because it has b0th height and width. Theref0re, we repeat the steps a sec0nd time t0 define the y-axis.

Gann references squares within cirdes with inner squares within cirdes bec0ming a f0urth dimensi0n. Mathematically speaking he is inc0rrect. He is n0t describing a f0urth dimensi0n.

{ 4OS }

---

4O6

A third dimensi0n is the z-axis and the f0urth we will dive int0 mathematically later. What Gann was referencing is the fractal pr0perties 0f the larger ge0metric pattem as it relates t0 the smaller.

This next c0ncept challenges m0st pe0ple when they are beginners. 1 place a Gann Fan 0n my chart in Figure 22.2, and the c0mputer marks 0ne angle as the “1 x 1” that implies a 4S° angle has been drawn. Has my c0mputer drawn a true 4S° angle in Figure 22.2? H0w d0 we check? H0w d0 1 fix it if needed? H0w many 0pti0ns d0 1 have t0 c0nsider if a change is needed? P0ssible 0pti0ns ifthe 1 x 1 is n0t a true 4S° angle might be the f0ll0wing:

A. C0rrect the aspect rati0 0f the chart display.

B. Change the price units 0f the Gann Fans by using the same units 0r fact0r set f0r the screen’s display.

D. Divide the default price unit 0f the fans drawn by the c0mputer by 2.

E. N0ne 0f the ab0ve 0pti0ns are c0rrect because there is width and height and 1 have t0 use a fact0r 0f 4.

Start with 0pti0n ‘E.’ 1 catch a l0t 0f pe0ple with this. If 1 draw a square b0x ar0und the Gann Fans as drawn in ‘Figure 22.1’ and multiply the square by 2, h0w many squares will there be 0n my c0mputer screen? The answer is f0ur because it is 2 times height and width. We are w0rking with a square and cann0t f0rget t0 multiply b0th sides. Answer E w0uld be inc0rrect. The 0pti0ns ‘A’ thr0ugh ‘D’ are c0rrect but 1 need t0 build understanding f0r y0u t0 kn0w h0w the ge0metry w0rks f0r Gann. We will c0ver these gradually.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

The best 0pti0n is m0st 0ften “B’: Change the price units 0f the Gann Fan by using the same units 0r fact0r used f0r the chart display. That means if a currency is displayed in an incremental price scale 0f 0.O8, the Gann Fan units 0r fact0r, depending 0n y0ur s0ftware vend0r, will als0 be 0.O8.

If 1 add a sec0nd set 0f Gann Fans what fact0r d0 1 use? All the Gann Fans 0n y0ur screen must use the same unit setup as the first set. What if 1 add a c0mputer-generated series 0f targets called a Square 0f Nine fr0m a price l0w? That t00l must als0 be set t0 the same fact0r such as 0.O8 as used in my last example. But this is where 1 can divide the fact0r by 2 because a 36O-degree target 0n a h0ri- z0ntal axis will dr0p d0wn t0 where the I8O-degree line used t0 be l0cated. Same idea if a Fib0nacci range fr0m a start marked 0% t0 the end 0f a range marked 100% is divided in half by dragging the 100% range ending d0wn t0 where the 50% subdivisi0n used t0 be l0cated. C0nfused? That’s Okay. It is w0rking... y0u are being depr0grammed and 90ing thr0ugh a preliminary exam t0 reveal all the wrinkles.

N0w l00k carefully at the chart itself in Figure 22.2 and specifically t0 the b0tt0m right 0f the screen. The b0tt0m left sh0ws that a screen aspect rati0 was set at ‘1.’ The number is just t0 the right 0f ‘Oct’ 0n the b0tt0m right. D0es this mean the 1 x 1 in Figure 22.2 was drawn at atrue 4S° angle? This is a big catch-up f0r many pe0ple. Y0ur screen rati0 may be set at ‘1, but unless y0ur Gann Fan is als0 set t0 use units 0f ‘1’ y0u d0 n0t have a 4S° angle. What did we draw? They are all speed lines and n0t a Gann meth0d, even th0ugh the name 0f the t00l y0u are using is called ‘Gann Fans.’ D0es the aspect rati0 0f the screen have t0 be set at ‘1’? N0. G00d questi0n. But why d0 Gann’s charts 0ften use ‘1’? (1 kn0w; s0me will think, Wait! There are Jupiter and

Satum scales and... but we are n0t 90ing there yet. Patience. We need every0ne t0 track t0gether 0n the same page when we get there.)

This is the m0st imp0rtant questi0n. Why was Gann f0rced t0 use the graph paper and fixed scaling we see m0st 0ften in his charts? 1 kn0w y0u will n0t get this 0ne at this time if y0u are n0t an ad- vanced Gann analyst, s0 let me jump ahead. The increments 0f Gann’s Square 0f Nine and Hexa90n Wheels ascend and descend by units 0f 1, n+1, and s0 f0rth thr0ugh the c0lumns and r0ws 0f his Wheels. Theref0re, every t00l he applied had t0 be calibrated t0 his Wheel calculat0rs. A 1 x 1 rise 0na chart can be used with the increments 0f 0ne within a Wheel. It makes 0ther meth0ds we will c0ver easier as well. Gann did everything by hand. If Figure 22.2 was a chart 0f the Nikkei, w0uld 1 see the price acti0n 0n my c0mputer screen if 1 used a scale 0f ‘1’? N0. The price range where the Nikkei trades requires we change the increments t0 4O s0 the y-axis is in a range that better fits the price acti0n f0r that market. Why we w0uld use 4O and h0w we determine this fact0r c0mes much later. The p0int n0w is simply t0 kn0w we will use a different value depending 0n the market we need t0 analyze. If 1 place a c0mputerized Gann Wheel beside the Nikkei chart 0r used a physical Square 0f Nine Wheel 0n my lap, w0uld a price sitting 0n a true 4S° angle 0n my screen be f0und in Gann’s physical Wheel 0n a 4S° radian als0? N0. L0ts 0f readers just had a mind impl0si0n. POOF. It never c0uld match because the Wheel has increments 0f 1 and my screen had increments 0f 4O. In 0rder t0 0btain the same results b0th must have the same incre- mental units. 1 w0uld have t0 make a new physical wheel template with a number sequence that had ascending 0r descending numbers by a fact0r 0f plus/minus 4O between each value. Only then w0uld the Wheel generate the c0rrect values. When we draw angles, apply

squares, 0r utilize a Gann Wheel, they must all use the same unit settings 0r intervals. They will n0t have t0 be ‘1, but they will all be the same.

All the time? Well, n0t really, because 1 can divide a Gann Fan display by 2 and create a 22.5° angle that will be drawn parallel t0 a true 4S° angle in the chart. If 1 gave the impressi0n that a fixed ‘rule’ can be defined, it w0uld get me int0 tr0uble much later.

N0w much 0f this is 90ing t0 just wash 0ff and scramble s0me pe0ple’s minds if y0u are just starting 0ut 0r have a weak f0undati0n. G00d. That’s fine. N0t the game plan but m0st likely the result. All 1 need is f0r y0u t0 leave any prec0nceived n0ti0ns y0u have 0n the fl00r. Then 1 can rebuild the scrambled pieces we just created int0 a better and str0nger understanding 0ne step at a time. If y0u are new, y0u d0n’t have any pieces t0 rec0nstruct. Always harder t0 unleam what y0u kn0w than t0 build fr0m scratch fr0m a blank slate. Y0u have the advantage!

IfI have drawn a set 0f angles 0n my chart using Optuma, h0w d0! check what angle has been drawn? We have a t00l called ‘Trendline.’ Draw a trendline and then in the pr0perties wind0w check the 0pti0n t0 display the angle and save it as the default. Any trendline y0u draw will n0w be labelled within a 36O° cirde. H0w will a 4S° line be labeled that is a dedining dia90nal drawn fr0m t0p left t0 b0tt0m right in a market using a scale 0f 1? The answer is n0t 4S° th0ugh it will be a 4S° angle. It will have a label 0f 315°. (36O° — 4S° equals 315°). It is always these smaller administrative things that kn0ck pe0ple f0r a l00p later. Best we get them 0ut 0f the r0ad n0w. When we read angles in an ephemeris, the 0° will be 0n the “West’ radian where Aries 0° begins. That is n0t 90ing t0 be fixed either. Welc0me

t0 Gann. Y0u will always be thinking ab0ut why y0u are d0ing this 0r that and d0es it make sense. Let’s start picking up the pieces 1 just created 0ff the fl00r.

B. FAN ANGLES

In this less0n we will c0ver what the fan angles are and devel0p an understanding that just because the c0mputer labels an angle as 1 x 1, it d0es n0t mean it is a 4S° angle.

An0ther questi0n: c0nsider Figure 22.3 in Exercise B. This is a 3-week C0tt0n chart. The questi0n is this: D0es this chart display fan angles? M0st will jump and say, “Yes.” N0, they are speed lines. Why? Figure 22.3 that l00ks s0 perfect is n0t Gann at all. D0 n0t get f00led just because all the lines are labeled with Gann n0tati0ns. The angle 0f separati0n in the set dedining fr0m a price high and the set 0riginating fr0m a price l0w have different angles. Even if 1 inverted the l0wer set, the angles w0uld never 0verlay the t0p set. These are speed lines and n0t Gann Fans. Gann’s charts all have Gann Fans that display the same angles as th0se drawn in Figure 22.1. The chart in Figure 22.3 was created simply by c0nnecting a selected price as the start t0 a piv0t 1 liked, and then the c0mputer calls it the 1 x 1 angle.

Figure 22.4 is the same data with c0rrect fan angles. The first step was t0 determine where a 4S-degree angle falls within this scale. The heavy black line gives the angle 315. (36O— 4S = 315 °) N0w use the t00l in Optuma called “Dynamic Gann Fan.” 1 had requested that this t00l snap t0 the m0use curs0r, s0 1 c0uld just draw the 1 x 1 within the fan set 0n t0p 0f a true 4S° angle when unsure 0f the price scaling. 1 d0 n0t want t0 change my scaling as 1 like the way the data l00ks.

A c0py/paste 0f the first Gann Fan drawn fr0m the price high is

4O9 used t0 create the d0wnward channel fr0m the t0p 0f the sec0ndary sharp swing back up after the high. We just created 0ur first ‘Tunnel Thru The Air. Take n0te 0f the price units. Use the same units f0r the Gann Fan that m0ves upwards fr0m the price l0w 0n the b0tt0m left.

N0w study the chart. This is entirely different and far m0re mean- ingful than the chart in Figure 22.3. F0r pe0ple wh0 have c0pied my charts fr0m my evening rep0rts, m0st 0ften the public charts were speed lines. There is a very big difference between Figures 22.3 and 22.4. Gann is given a bad rap 0ften by pe0ple using speed lines and calling them Gann angles.

The questi0n 0f where t0 start a Gann Fan requires the ability t0 read price data intemals between the extremes. The best way is t0 study Gann’s charts. We will use the price high and l0w 0f the market. We will use the sec0ndary swing that fails t0 make a new extreme high 0r l0w. We will use gaps and str0ng bars within the intemal swing. That is where my Fib0nacci c0nfluence f0ll0wers will have the edge. They already kn0w h0w t0 use these intemal markers and why.

Figure 22.Sa sh0ws fragments fr0m charts in the public d0main 0n the Intemet. N0t the easiest fragments t0 see, but the angles and 0riginati0n p0ints are all we need. The t0p left frame is imp0rtant. By drawing parallel angles fr0m a l0w at p0int ‘D’ and the sec0ndary pullback at price ‘E,; the m0st imp0rtant trendline channel will be defined. The b0tt0m-left frame is just a fragment 0f a st0ck chart badly stained and damaged. H0wever, it is en0ugh t0 see h0w Gann used gaps. He pr0jected 2 angles fr0m the price high 0f the b0tt0m 0f the gap d0wnwards and used the price l0w at the t0p 0f the gap t0 set 0ne angle m0ving upwards. The chart 0n the far right 0f Figure 22.Sa is Gann’s Egg chart enlarged. The channel is created fr0m price high G and F. ‘F’ is a d0uble t0p and the same angle repeats 0n the piv0t

just bel0w and t0 the right 0f ‘F.’ There are l0ts 0f examples 0nline 0f charts and angles fr0m l0ws and highs, but these subtle starting p0ints 0ffer a quick visual summary 0f the m0st imp0rtant. An example 0f

4I3 angles drawn fr0m descending price piv0t highs is seen in Gann’s chart in Figure 22.Sb f0r Savage Arms Inc. This chart is interesting as an Elli0tt Wave study. The rally fr0m I922 int0 the I92S bl0w-0ff high is a dear five-wave impulse pattem. The dedine int0 the I92S l0w is wave (1) d0wn. The swing up int0 early I926 is wave A 0f (2) up and a dear 3-wave c0rrective pattem. The dr0p that f0ll0ws int0 late I927 is wave B d0wn 0f (2) up. The rally that f0ll0ws int0 the descending trendline angle in I928 is wave C 0f (2) up. Death dr0p f0ll0ws. M0st Elli0tt practiti0ners w0uld have expected the pattem t0 f0ll0w c0nventi0n and retrace back t0 the I926 high. The descending Gann angles w0uld save y0u fr0m making this mistake. Equity futures 0ften pr0duce ‘C’ wave rallies 0f this pr0p0rti0n bef0re massive third wave dedines unf0ld. D0n’t get f00led by the size. As the third wave d0wn unf0lds y0ur screen will rescale and suddenly the huge C 0f (2) up will n0t l00k s0 large. There will always be a c0nfluence 0f Gann Time Fact0rs at the t0p 0f wave C t0 put a nail in the c0ffin.

When a d0uble b0tt0m f0rms with price swing l0ws extremely d0se t0gether, Gann uses the first swing d0wn behind the sec0nd swing defining the d0uble b0tt0m (0r d0uble t0p) t0 generate the Gann Fan. That is n0t intuitive f0r me because it 90es against the Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne applicati0n where 1 cann0t use data that has been re- traced. 1 create a channel using b0th piv0t p0ints.

We discussed in Chapter 2I h0w we c0uld divide the 36O-degree channels 0f planetary lines int0 halves 0r thirds creating 2 0r 3 harm0nic subdivisi0ns. Gann describes this appr0ach t0 s0lve a pr0blem in C0urse F0ur 0f his St0ck C0urse f0r adding parallel 4S° angles. “When the angles are very far apart, y0u can draw an0ther 4S° angle equidistant between them, which is 0ften a str0ng supp0rt angle...”

1 w0uld rec0mmend fr0m experience that y0u subdivide using the price high 0r l0w within the range 0f a str0ng bar 0r gap and n0t the mathematical mean between the 4S° channel. In this Gann and 1 differ.

What Gann did n0t d0, but 1 have d0ne f0r years, is use the str0ng bars within the trend that 1 teach f0r selecting ranges t0 create Fi- b0nacci c0nfluence z0nes. They are str0ng ge0metric markers that have defined final targets s0 0ften f0r 0ver nearly thirty years that 1 have t0 add this placement rec0mmendati0n f0r y0u. Figure 22.6 is the D0w J0nes Industrial Average daily chart. This price range requires me t0 use an angle 0f 22.5 rather than 4S. N0tice 1 am n0t using any 0ther angles. We are 900d pr0vided the angle is a multiple 0f 2. The trendline was established fr0m 0ne price p0int. ‘A’ is the start 0f a third wave rally. P0int ‘A’ is als0 a very small gap. This example was selected t0 make the p0int that y0u d0n’t have t0 think ‘GAP.’ A min0r small ‘gap’ is just as imp0rtant when it c0mes t0 ge- 0metry markers. The single bar at ‘A’ is wave iii 0f 3 in a small degree advance. As we kn0w the angle t0 use, 0nly 0ne p0int is required t0 draw a trendline. This is s0 much better than elementary IOI trends that require tw0 price p0ints and a third f0r c0nfirmati0n. That is 0ld- sch00l thinking in t0day’s fast markets. If y0u trace the line pr0jected fr0m ‘A’ backwards, it c0nnects with the str0ng bar f0ll0wing the key reversal 0n the b0tt0m left 0f the chart. The key reversal was used t0 pr0ject a parallel channel as a sec0nd step. C0untless times 1 have seen the result implied by this chart. The August l0w dr0ps dead int0 the trendline and st0ps.

1 kn0w s0me0ne is 90ing t0 be c0nfused ab0ut my use 0f 22.5°. 1’ll sh0w y0u why that w0rks. Instead 0f the square 0f 9O, we are really using the square 0f 4S when 1 draw an angle 0f 22.SO. But the 4S° angle and 22.5° angle are parallel.

Figure 22.7 is Caterpillar in a price scale 0f 0.37S. Why d0 1 use 0.37S? 1 like it that way. N0 0ther reas0n. 1 then added the Square 0f 9O fr0m the piv0t defining the start 0f the r 4S° trendline fr0m the price l0w in 20O9. Why d0es the Square 0f 9O n0t c0ver a price range 0f 9O? The price scale is 0.37S. T0 keep a true 4S° angle, the Gann square units were changed t0 0.37S as well. The rati0 is c0rrect t0 create a true 4S° 1 X 1.

N0w l00k at the f0ur squares in the chart that are shaded in the l0wer middle 0f the chart. When we divide the square 0f 9O by 2, h0w many squares d0 we get? F0ur. Remember t0 divide the width by 2 and the height. The f0ur new squares are the Square 0f 4S and fit within the b0undary 0f 0ne Square 0f 9O. H0wever, the 4S-degree angle in the Square 0f 4S and 9O remain parallel. As l0ng as 1 divide 0r multiply by 2, we are 900d t0 90.

Gann writes in C0urse F0ur (St0cks), “It sh0uld be easy f0r y0u t0 tell with y0ur eye where the str0ngest supp0rt p0int 0r resistance p0int is. It is at the center where all the angles cr0ss.” As 1 write this segment 1 kn0w that we have such a situati0n in Crude Oil Futures. Figure 22.8 c0uld n0t be a m0re perfect example 0f Gann’s descripti0n. It is still under resistance but f0r m0nths Oil has c0mpressed int0 the center 0f the Square 0f the Range.

stantial and the questi0n is, Where is the pressure building? Use y0ur 0scillat0rs and Elli0tt Wave pattem as y0ur guide. In Figure 22.8 the Elli0tt wave structure 0f the rally is inc0mplete. We c0uld theref0re be in a bullish c0ns0lidating triangle that sees a str0ng upwards res0- luti0n. That in the big picture is n0t 900d news because we kn0w that a hard break w0uld f0ll0w back t0wards the dedining dia90nal that is under the 50% divis0r 0f the Square. Why d0 1 feel s0 str0ngly ab0ut tw0 swings in the future? It is related t0 the Time Fact0rs c0upled with Elli0tt wave structure. 1 kn0w the pattem, but n0t the ‘when.’ Once we kn0w the ‘when’ we can then define a scenari0 that explains h0w the market will m0ve int0 these Gann Time Fact0rs. Why d0 1 think the l0wer dia90nal angle c0uld be the target if Oil can break t0 higher prices? 1 kn0w that that is the 0nly area 0f supp0rt where b0th Gann c0nfluence levels 0f supp0rt/ resistance and Fib0nacci c0n- fluence z0nes 0verlap. We will l00k at h0w these targets are created at an0ther time. C0uld 1 see a matching Elli0tt pattem that fits these levels and p0ssible swings? Yes. Theref0re, there is a strategy be- ginning t0 f0rm that we then cr0ss-check in 0ther markets such as the EURUSD, Saudi TASI and T0r0nt0 TSX. Figure 22.8 0ffers an intr0ducti0n t0 Gann’s use 0f fan angles t0 subdivide a defined pr0- p0rti0nal space 0f price and time.

While Figure 22.Sa sh0wed us basic starting price p0siti0ns fr0m which t0 pr0ject angles, they are n0t the 0nly p0ints Gann used. An0ther meth0d is pr0jecting angles fr0m the h0riz0ntal zer0 line aligned with a price swing high. Again, the critical step is having a true 4S° angle in the chart and kn0wing the units 0f the price scale. The 1 x 1 at 4S° and 1 x 2 lines must be c0rrect angles.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

Figure 22.9 is the German Dax in a 2-week bar chart. It is n0t nec- essary t0 pl0t every fan angle; s0me are tumed 0ff because we 0nly need the relevant 0nes 0n the chart based 0n the price data and current bars. Here y0u see me pr0ject tw0 angles fr0m the zer0-h0riz0n level, as Gann instructs, that align under the pr0minent swing t0ps. The sec0nd set 0f angles under a pr0minent price high have been selected based 0n a Gann Time Fact0r n0t seen in this chart. A distributi0n market t0p is c0mplex and 0nly Gann’s time cydes can guide us. The sec0nd swing high failed under the 4S° angle that was created fr0m pr0jecting angles fr0m the zer0-h0riz0n that aligned directly under the first piv0t high. The sec0nd set 0f angles has n0w created a trendline which the German Dax is currently hugging just ab0ve the critical 4S° angle 0f supp0rt. D0 n0tice that the Dax failed at the recent market high under a parallel 4S° angle pr0jected fr0m the first retracement after the price l0ws 0f the 20O8 meltd0wn. 1 cann0t repeat this 0ften en0ugh—d0 n0t use the price l0w, but the first retracement within the new trend. It has been pr0ven repeatedly in all markets and time h0riz0ns that this is the c0rrect placement.

Gann tells us t0 use the extreme highs and l0ws, but we als0 see within his 0wn w0rk h0w he creates a ‘Tunnel’ 0r channel. Gann als0 writes, “Y0u sh0uld 90 back 0ver past rec0rds and bring up these angles and square 0ut t0ps and b0tt0ms s0 that y0u can pr0ve t0 y0urself the great value 0f these angles.”

The next applicati0n pr0jects an angle fr0m an imp0rtant market l0w in m0nthly and weekly charts that extends the angle t0 the zer0 line. The angle will then swing upwards 0ff the zer0-h0riz0n, abiding by the Law 0f Reflecti0n, which states that the angle 0f reflecti0n will equal the angle 0f incidence.

This is a widely misused meth0d by students wh0 bring examples

t0 me. Let’s d0 this 0ne in tw0 steps. Figure 22.IO is the India BSE 30-m0nthly chart. This applicati0n starts fr0m a price l0w. The pr0- jected angles trend int0 the zer0-h0riz0ntal level. The angles 0f in- cidence and reflecti0n are equal—all l00ks 900d. Where the zer0 line reflects the angle, a vertical line can be drawn. The implicati0n is that the p0int at which the angle reflects is a cyde date. L00ks 900d as the market has, in an appr0ximate manner, respected all f0ur vertical cyde beats. W0w, this is the next best thing t0 pre-sliced bread. What c0uld be wr0ng? The pr0blem is f0und in the pr0perties frame 0n the left where we see a check-mark t0 use the chart’s price units. But the scale 0f the chart cirded 0n the b0tt0m right is I7I. Y0u have lines alright, but 0f n0 meaning. Y0u w0uld have t0 uncheck the b0x that states “use chart price units” which is a vend0r default value at their discreti0n.

When y0u uncheck the b0x stating “use chart price units, the chart can then be c0rrectly set up. 1 must use ‘I7I’ 0r the exact value 0f the scale 0n the b0tt0m right. Be sure the screen display is l0cked s0 y0u d0 n0t ruin y0ur 4S° angle in err0r by scr0lling y0ur m0use wheel. When the aspect rati0 is l0cked, the height and width pr0p0rti0ns will remain fixed; h0wever y0u can z00m in 0r 0ut.

Figure 22.11 is the m0nthly India BSE 30 bar chart sh0wing the c0rrect applicati0n 0f these angles. S0me 0f these l0ng-range angles d0 n0t have t0 be 0n this chart--n0rmally 1 w0uld tum 0ff the first three d0sest t0 the vertical axis t0 rem0ve the dutter. What ab0ut the vertical lines? If 1 c0uld, 1 w0uld have shut them 0ff as well. My understanding is that the next s0ftware versi0n will all0w this. 1 fav0r astr0n0mical events 0ver using ge0metric meth0ds f0r time cydes. In the India BSE 30 chart, the greatest value is the 4S° angle 0f reflecti0n, which this market is dearly respecting f0r the maj0r

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

uptrend. It als0 means when this 4S° angle is br0ken the c0rrecti0n sh0uld be significant. It is s0 imp0rtant that this angle be c0rrect that if y0u l00k d0sely, y0u'll find that a segment 0f the 4S° angle has a heavier black trendline placed 0ver it near m0re recent data. The trendline t00l c0nfirms that the angle is a true 4S° angle. When a line in a chart is this critical, 1 will check t0 see that the vend0r has n0t made changes 0r that an0ther unkn0wn change has n0t de- vel0ped. This is especially true when 1 kn0w that upgrades are being d0wnl0aded.

Figure 22.I2 applies angles reflecting 0ff the zer0-h0riz0ntal level in m0nthly C0ffee Futures. Impressive right? F0r speed lines, they are. The scale has never been adjusted t0 define a 4S° angle t0 create fan angles. 1 kn0w 1 am fl0gging a dead h0rse 0n this p0int, but d0 n0t get suckered in just because the hist0rical results l00k w0nderful. Our missi0n is t0 analyze f0r future trendlines 0f interest, n0t t0 create charts with spectacular ‘w0w’ fact0rs in hist0rical ge0metries using speed lines that we never traded.

D. BALANCE

N0te the f0ll0wing pertinent inf0rmati0n fr0m Gann.

Always remember that the 50% reacti0n 0r half-way p0int 0f the range 0f fluctuati0n 0r 0f the extreme highest-p0int 0f a st0ck 0r any particular m0ve is the m0st imp0rtant p0int f0r supp0rt 0n the d0wnside 0r f0r meeting selling and resistance 0n the way up. This is the balancing p0int because it divides the range 0f fluctuati0n int0 tw0 equal parts... The wider the range and the l0nger the peri0d, the m0re imp0rtant is this half-way p0int when it is reached. (C0urse Three in “St0ck Trading C0urse”).

What that b0ils d0wn t0 is this: The 4S° angle equally divides the space 0f price and time. There are phrases like ‘center 0f gravity’ and ‘f0urth dimensi0n’ t0ssed ab0ut that have n0 scientific basis except t0 emphasize the imp0rtance 0f being centered and t0 be at an equi- librium p0int. We saw an example in Crude Oil in Figure 22.8.

The balance 0f Time and Price is defined by the 4S° angle. But is this practical in t0day’s markets? It remains imp0rtant. The India BSE 30 m0st certainly 0ffered capital gains pr0vided y0u knew h0w t0 c0rrectly 0verlay and set the angles sh0wn in Figure 22.11. The BSE 30 trendline f0r the rally is the 4S° angle.

But Gann’s entire emphasis regarding balance 0n the 4S° angle is m0st meaningful when the market is challenging this line. Many 0f t0day’s markets are running in parab0lic rallies. We kn0w they are 0ut 0f balance and 0verextended. Markets can extend a very l0ng time. It is s0mewhat impractical because we have t0 live within the parab0lic m0ves 0f the day. That is why 1 set new 4S° angled lines fr0m Fib0nacci C0nfluence supp0rt z0nes. | especially want t0 use the price levels where Gann and Fib0nacci c0nfluences 0verlap. These tw0 c0nfluence z0nes that merge are the building bl0cks f0r future dia90nal angles that ac- curately define future market reversals. H0wever, we need t0 kn0w the Time Fact0r t0 determine the p0int 0n the rising angle t0 be the trigger p0int. We kn0w 0ver-extended markets will s0meday crash in a freefall back t0 key 4S° angles, but when? The t00ls we need t0 answer this critical questi0n reside in the chapter discussi0ns t0 f0ll0w.

E. BALANCE 15 MORE THAN TECHNICAL ANALYS15

Years 0f trading have taught me that success is a blend 0f Gann, Elli0tt Wave, and Fib0nacci. N0 single meth0d d0es it all. 1 have had pe0ple

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

travel fr0m afar, and all they wanted t0 kn0w was Gann. But they did n0t realize that a reliable m0ney-pr0ducing meth0d is a blend 0f meth0ds and disciplines. Gann taught us t0 use the c0nvergence 0f technical meth0ds 0n the dia90nal, h0riz0ntal, and vertical axes.

H0wever, trading is m0re than a balance 0f the meth0ds that y0u have f0und valuable after years 0f study. Y0u will be tested in ways y0u cann0t imagine. In the I99Os 1 ran int0 a seri0us tax pr0blem. The IRS t00k my h0me, my savings, and anything else n0t nailed d0wn. 1 have never had an inheritance. 1 am sharing this because Ge0rge Lane, my ment0r wh0 picked the shattered pieces up 0ff the em0ti0nal fl00r, t0ld me then that every seri0us trader did n0t begin until they had been bl0wn 0ut 0f the market at least 0nce. He said until y0u have c0me back fr0m net zer0, y0u will never kn0w the real strength 0f wh0 y0u are, what y0u kn0w, and what y0u can achieve. 1 had t0 start fr0m n0thing. But starting fr0m zer0 is never really n0thing because they can never take away the kn0wledge that y0u have.

Only years later did 1 build a beautiful h0me 0n a fam0us 90lf c0urse in Litchfield in Pawleys Island, S0uth Car0lina. F0ur years later 1 m0ved inland and built a $2 milli0n equestrian farm in an exdusive c0mmunity 0f similar small executive h0rse farms. Then 20O8 taught me that real estate was n0t as safe as 1 had th0ught. 1 had been smart en0ugh t0 sell in 20OS near the market t0p in Pawley’s Island when 1 saw c0nd0miniums being built where magnificent 20O-year 0ld live 0ak trees had 0nce st00d. (1 am still angry ab0ut th0se trees being cut d0wn. H0w stupid can we be?) But when 1 built my farm, my builder t00k the cash draws and used them t0 build tw0 spec h0mes assuming he w0uld flip th0se pr0perties bef0re he had t0 c0mplete mine. In 20O6 he ran 0ut 0f cash and c0uld n0t c0mplete my c0n- structi0n. 1 had t0 p0ur in an additi0nal twenty-five percent cash,

bl0wing my plan t0 be financially cauti0us as 1 knew the real estate bubble was ab0ut t0 burst. Our farm values fell seventy-f0ur percent in 20O8 in the crash. It was nearly imp0ssible t0 get an appraisal as n0 0ne wanted t0 risk being wr0ng. Prices started t0 rise in 20I4 0nly after 0ur area was awarded the W0rld Equestrian Games, an Olym- pic-style gathering that happens every f0ur years s0mewhere in the w0rld. It is a big deal. Teams and individuals win a place t0 c0mpete in the 2020 T0ky0 Olympic Games. Arab teams b0ught farms, and teams trained and invested in milli0n-d0llar facilities s0 that they c0uld c0ntr0l the f00ting 0f their arenas. My farm was 22 minutes away fr0m the Try0n Intemati0nal Equestrian Center. 1 saw it was my 0nly chance t0 sell. Decisi0ns all made fr0m charts. The area was way 0verextended with all these new facilities f0r every team. Real estate trends f0r my area had retumed t0 the underside 0f 4S° angles. Run! said my trader gut: Run, F0rest, run! Then 1 did n0t buy up; 1 b0ught d0wn. 1 b0ught in the center 0f the t0wn 0f Try0n and put $2SO,OOO int0 a building that was a hist0ric st0ne wreck. When y0u l00ked past the beautiful tw0-f00t thick st0ne walls and l0g interi0r, y0u f0und 60-amp fuse electric service, 0ld lead plumbing, n0 insu- lati0n t0p 0r b0tt0m, and the need 0f a new r00f, kitchen, bathr00ms, landscaping—y0u have the picture. The building will be 100 years 0ld in 2023 and had never been t0uched. Where did the funds c0me fr0m? Trading. The reas0n 1 share this is t0 sh0w y0u that y0u can start with little and find the future y0u want f0r y0urself and family. But Ge0rge Lane taught me a valuable less0n ab0ut balance.

Life has a way 0f wanting t0 see h0w str0ng y0u are fr0m a maj0r b0tt0m. 1 was unable t0 trade t0 the l0ng side after 9/11 when 1 knew a maj0r b0tt0m was appr0aching in 20O3. But unable t0 buy with0ut PTSD issues 1 shut d0wn my hedge fund. Assets went t0ward building

42S

the farm and c0ntributing t0 the building 0f an American sch00l in the Middle East. In December 20O2 my fund was d0sed and all assets retumed. 1 kn0w n0w 1 was m0uming a sec0nd maj0r death in as many years—this time my 0wn, as the fund was wh0 1 was then and was the balance p0int f0r my self-esteem.

1 guess 1 cann0t leave y0u there. What reignited my s0ul? An in- vitati0n t0 ride an Arabian Stalli0n acr0ss the Kuwaiti desert 0n the Iraqi b0rder 0nly seven days bef0re the start 0f the sec0nd Gulf War. F0uzi said, “Y0u might hear b0mbs in the distance.” 1 said, “Keep them 0n the 0ther side—1’m c0ming!” When 1 was given an Arab Bihst d0ak t0 wear 0ne night and keep, 1 c0uld n0t shut 0ff the theme fr0m Lawrence 0f Arabia running thr0ugh my head. (1 av0ided the dance... with difficulty.) It still rings thr0ugh my head when 1 wear it curled up bef0re the fire pit. The 90ld trim sparkles as the embers rise int0 the night air. As a side n0te, during that visit 1 desperately needed a Gann Wheel. They c0uld n0t believe where 1 was and the address 1 needed it shipped t0 by Federal Express 0r DHL. Nikki J0nes and Ken Gerber came thr0ugh and the wheel arrived. 1 flew 0ut 0f Kuwait just bef0re the war br0ke 0ut. (Thank y0u, Mr. Gann!) G0ing thr0ugh cust0ms in America the 0fficer stemly said, “Y0u kn0w a war is ab0ut t0 break 0ut, right? Why were y0u in Kuwait?” 1 t0ld the 0fficer 1’d 90ne t0 ride an Arabian h0rse acr0ss the desert 0n the fr0nt-line. He paused, and then he laughed 0ut l0ud a huge belly laugh. All the 0ther 0fficers d0wn the line p0pped up t0 see what was happening like marm0ts p0pping 0ut 0f their gr0und h0les. The 0fficer bef0re me said, “In thirty years 1 have never cracked a laugh.” He was ab0ut t0 retire, and this was his last day. “N0w get 0ut 0f here,” he said. “Only a dumb American w0uld give me an answer like that!”

Y0u see, balance is n0t 0nly ab0ut what is 0n y0ur c0mputer screen.

Balance f0r a trader is als0 inside 0f y0u. On March I3th 0f 20O3, 1 gave the l0ng p0siti0n trade t0 my dients reading my nightly rep0rt. The rep0rt was p0sted fr0m Kuwait and w0uld be the last f0r a while. 1 t0ld them that this b0tt0m w0uld be in place f0r years t0 c0me. That market b0tt0m was the day 1 knew my career was ab0ut t0 make a maj0r transiti0n with this price piv0t because PTSD kept me fr0m buying. H0wever, the next day w0uld start the adventure 0f a lifetime. The sec0nd Gulf War began March 20th, 20O3. Ge0rge Lane had taught me well. T0 get 0ut 0f a funk y0u must up the pressure in y0ur life bey0nd the pressure y0u think y0u are trapped in, n0t lie back d0wn 0r y0u will dr0wn in it. F0r me, running t0ward a war re-

ignited my inner spark plugs and retumed s0me balance. Extreme? Yes, but it was h0w 1 f0und my balance after 9/11.

Bel0w are the charts and c0mments in that rep0rt t0 sh0w y0u h0w market integrati0n is essential. The l0ng-winded text leading int0 this rep0rt was n0t repeated f0r dients because we had been tracking the bread-crumbs f0r weeks int0 this market b0tt0m. The early versi0n 0f Market-Analyst s0ftware had a f0nt pr0blem 1 liked. Y0u never knew the aspects 1 was using as the f0nt type was missing and rand0m characters were displayed. But d0 n0tice the duster near the high never 0ccurred again until the b0tt0m. This is 0ne 0f the ways Gann knew the durati0n 0f l0ng trends.

CHAPTER 23

Less0n Three: Angles, Aspects, Trend Durati0n, and Harm0nic Angles

A. “NATURAL LAW, ‘NATURAL TIME, AND “NATURAL DATES’

Pri0r chapters intr0duced y0u t0 Max Heindel’s b00k Simplified Sci- entific Astr0l0gy published in I9O9. Max Heindel was the f0under 0f the R0sicrucian Fell0wship, and the 0rganizati0n is still active t0day. While 1 knew that “Natural Law” meant planetary m0ti0n and astr0- l0gical events, 1 did n0t get it until 1 read Heindel’s b00k.

In I9O9 it was c0mm0nplace t0 distinguish between “Natural Time” and Mean Standard Time. Other w0rds and phrases were transp0sed 0ver the century. The I9O9 use 0f the w0rds “stellar vibrati0ns” was the c0mm0n term we kn0w t0day as “transits.” It did n0t mean s0mething mystical 0r have deeper meaning. Heindel’s frequent use 0f “vibrati0n” and artides that used the phrase “Natural Law” sh0w these terms are dearly the c0mm0n vemacular 0f the day. Gann was n0t writing in a veiled language at all, but in the language 0f Free- mas0ns. We are the 0nes that tumed it int0 s0mething 0f greater hidden meaning.

When y0u understand h0w Tunnel was c0nstructed, it was dear that Gann used the w0rd natural in ways Heindel did n0t. That distincti0n was very helpful as y0u will see when we c0ver Gann’s b00k H0w t0 Make Pr0fits Trading in C0mm0dities later in this chapter.

Even in I9O9 Heindel writes 0f the separati0n 0f “scientific” fr0m

the “spiritual” study 0f the “celestial sciences.’! He 90es 0n t0 ref- erence B0de’s Law t0 challenge Neptune’s place in 0ur s0lar system. It is n0t the challenge that is 0f such great interest, but the descripti0n 0f B0de’s Law. It is a Law 0f Vibrati0n vect0r being described th0ugh that is n0t his intent.

“The Law is this: If we write a series 0f 4s, add 3 t0 the sec0nd, 6 t0 the third, I2 t0 the f0urth, etc., d0ubling the am0unt added each time, the resulting series 0f numbers is a very d0se pr0ximati0n t0 the relative distances 0f the planets fr0m the Sun, with the excepti0n 0f Neptune.

What is ast0nishing is that this simplified descripti0n d0sely aligns with NASA’s references t0 “A.U’s.” 0r Astr0n0mical Distances.

Because 0f their inv0lvement in the technical w0rk 0f defining the p0siti0n 0f the planets and their physical relati0nships t0 each 0ther, b0th Heindel and Gann viewed their w0rk as “scientific.” This chapter deals with the heart 0f Gann time analysis and is the m0st imp0rtant t0 leam f0r understanding and using Time Fact0rs.

S0me 0f Heindel’s “scientific” references are 0ut 0f place in t0day’s awareness 0f astr0n0my, but his p0int 0f separati0n between what we call Westem Astr0l0gy and Astr0n0my is well made. In I9O9 the w0rd astr0l0gy was used f0r b0th fields 0f study, and that likely muddies the waters and percepti0ns 0f pe0ple t0day regarding Gann analysis. Heindel went as far as t0 write, “Beware 0f pr0stituting the science 0f the stars t0 the gutter 0f f0rtune-telling.”

The c0ncept 0f scientific relati0nships between the Sun and planets t0 Earth was ev0lving in leaps and b0unds during Gann’s early years as a student 0f the markets. We kn0w Gann’s pattem 0f repeating things as his way 0f sh0wing what was imp0rtant f0r him. One sci- entist deeply influenced his w0rk.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

Gann’s first reference t0 Michael Faraday was in the I9O9 interview with Richard Wyck0ff. Gann menti0ns Faraday (I79I-I867), a British scientist wh0se w0rk 0n electr0magnetism and electr0chemistry was highly regarded. Einstein kept a picture 0f Faraday 0n his study wall.

We leamed ab0ut EMF, 0r electr0magnetic fields, in Chapter 20 when the dedassified rep0rt 0f the U.5. Department 0f the Navy c0nduded that the det0nati0ns 0f numer0us sea mines 0ff 0f Vietnam were likely caused by a magnetic st0rm.

There is n0 chance in nature, because mathematical principles 0f the

highest 0rder lie at the f0undati0n 0f all things. Faraday said, ‘There is

n0thing in the universe but mathematical p0ints 0f f0rce’

[Ticker and Investment Digest, December I9O9, as distributed in ‘Gann’s _ Marketing Br0chure, “I936 Scientific St0ck F0recasting.”]

Gann repeats himself years later:

There is n0 chance in nature, because mathematical principles 0f the highest 0rder are at the f0undati0n 0f all things. Faraday said: ‘There is n0thing in the Universe but mathematical p0ints 0f f0rce.’

A new degree 0f the z0diac arises 0n the eastem h0riz0n every 4 minutes. 1 believe it is Heindel wh0 first c0ined the phrase “Time Fact0r.” As we kn0w fr0m earlier chapters, an ephemeris is s0 named because it rec0rds the ephemeral 0r m0mentary p0siti0n 0f all the planets as seen fr0m the 0bservat0ry at Greenwich each day at n00n.

A S0lar Day is the time it takes the Sun t0 m0ve fr0m 0ne meridian 0f l0ngitude until it retums t0 the same meridian the next day. Because 0f the Earth’s axis tilt 0f 23.5-degrees and the variable m0ti0n 0f the

23. Less0n Three: Angles, Aspects, Trend Durati0n, and Harm0nic Angles

Earth’s 0rbit, the S0lar Days that c0rresp0nd t0 the Sun’s path are n0t 0f equal length thr0ugh0ut the year. H0wever, civil life requires standardizati0n fr0m day t0 day. Theref0re, all S0lar days in a year are averaged t0 create a Mean S0lar Day f0r use as “d0ck-time.” But the “Natural” time, 0r true Sun-Time, will theref0re be different fr0m d0ck-time.

H0w much d0 Natural and d0ck-time vary? Fr0m the time the Sun is nearest the Earth 0n December 24th (periheli0n), t0 the time when it is farthest away 0n June 2Ist (apheli0n), d0ck-time is ahead 0f natural 0r sun-time. The greatest difference is I6 minutes near the start 0f N0vember. Fr0m June 2Ist t0 December 24th, d0ck-time is sl0wer than true Sun-Time. Only f0ur times a year are d0cks and natural time in agreement: April 15th, June 15th, September Ist and December 24th. (My guess is y0u did n0t see th0se dates c0ming unless this kind 0f thing was y0ur maj0r.)

The difference between a s0lar day and a sidereal day is ab0ut 4 minutes. The s0lar day is the l0nger as the Sun m0ves farther east playing catch-up during the time 0f the Earth’s daily r0tati0n 0n its axis. While the Earth must tum farther 0n its axis bef0re it c0mes in line with the Sun 0n the same meridian, even this varies each day due t0 the 0bliquity 0f the ediptic plane.

We kn0w that the start 0f the new year is the spring equin0x, based 0n the angle 0f the Sun. In the N0rthem Hemisphere this will 0ccur between March I9 and March 2I. It is 0nly a m0ment, n0ta full day, when the Sun is directly 0ver the equat0r and divides day and night equally. This is 0ur first Gann Time Fact0r.

Using the 0uter dial 0f a Gann Wheel, we can place the 0° angle 0n the 0uter ring 0f Figure 23.1 s0 that it aligns t0 March 2Ist. We then place an 0verlay 0f subdivisi0ns 0f 4S° each. In Figure 23.1 the

22S° subdivisi0n aligns t0 the date 0f N0vember 7th. This is an im- p0rtant Time Fact0r. The current date as 1 write is N0vember 8th, 20I8. What happened N0vember 7th? The DJIA ran up +S4S p0ints, the 5&PSOO m0ved +S8.44, and U.5. Treasury b0nds? 2ip squat in c0mparis0n. B0nds are a trine market, n0t a square market acc0rding t0 0ur earlier w0rk f0r the Law 0f Vibrati0n. Natural Dates as a Time Fact0r f0r B0nds will fall 0n th0se calendar dates aligned 0n 30° sub- divisi0ns fr0m the Spring Equin0x.

N0vember 7th in America was a mid-term electi0n day. Regardless 0f the results, the market was 0n a cyde that w0uld significantly m0ve the index in either directi0n. L00king at the intemals 0f the price data, we see that Apple, IBM, and Micr0s0ft all 0ffered a waming that the m0ve w0uld be upwards. This was the f0recast pr0vided dients bef0re the electi0n results were kn0wn. Figure 23.2 sh0ws a chart f0r Apple (AAPL) and Micr0s0ft N0vember 7th intraday. H0wever, such market p0ps can be sh0rt lived. The Elli0tt Wave c0unt was inc0mplete t0 the d0wnside and the str0ng reversal s00n w0uld meet resistance and a full failure t0 the 0ld l0ws. This reacti0n happens frequently.

B. PLANETARY ANGLES

Gann was pr0ficient with astr0n0mical angles and 0ther scientific analysis very early in his career. As we saw in Figure I9.8, Gann was 0n the Freemas0n’s 20diac C0uncil and influenced the presentati0n 0f their first annual ephemeris fr0m the Astr0l0gical S0ciety, Inc. 0f New Y0rk. His Time Fact0rs are the reas0n f0r his success, and he t0ld us 0ften t0 l00k there.

display angles 0f separati0n that are n0t astr0l0gy c0nventi0ns f0r the very 900d reas0n that the Time Fact0rs are astr0n0mical calculati0ns and n0t f0r astr0l0gy purp0ses. There will be numer0us examples thr0ugh0ut this b00k. When the Sun cr0sses the cusp 0f Aries 0°, we are really referencing the angle 0f the Sun. When a planet cr0sses the cusp 0f a z0diac sign every 30° it is called an ingress cyde. We can study any angle 0f any planet 0r aster0id t0 any 0ther planet b0dy in ways Gann c0uld n0t. Are Gann’s angles still valid t0day and h0w d0 we 90 ab0ut testing 0ne?

The distance 0f the M00n relative t0 Earth is a cyde Gann f0ll0wed. But he was very limited in what he c0uld use. We begin with a study t0 evaluate the cyde when Mars is farthest fr0m the Sun at its apheli0n distant p0int al0ng its 0rbital path. Then we want t0 kn0w if this cyde has any value with the 5&PSOO m0nthly data. Then we w0uld like t0 kn0w if the cyde w0rked in the near-term cyde 0ccurrences, s0 we w0uld kn0w that it is still valid.

Figure 23.3 sh0ws the 5&PSOO m0nthly data as a line-0n-d0se pl0t. Bel0w the price data are the 0ccurrences when Mars is at its farthest p0int fr0m the Sun. The inner data b0x frames 0n the far right sh0w an efficiency test. We want t0 kn0w the general trend IO peri0ds bef0re the culminati0n and IO peri0ds after thr0ugh0ut 0ur data sample. What we see is that this culminati0n is a peri0d 0f trend interrupti0ns but that the trend resumes tw0 peri0ds later. That is valuable inf0r- mati0n. Gann had n0 way 0f kn0wing that level 0f detail as t0 h0w a cyde influences the market.

The t0p left inner b0x tells us that the c0rrelati0n 0f this culminati0n influence is very high. It reads 0.83%. The last questi0n is h0w well the market resp0nded t0 this cyde during the last f0ur culminati0ns, s0 that we can understand ifit is still active c0mpared t0 the full range

0f the data sample. The right-side frame c0ntains a sec0nd line that is much thinner than the primary 0ne. The faint line is the result f0r 0nly the last 4 nearby cydes. We see it is still tracking the larger data sample results.

A single angle 0f a planet using vari0us criteria is easy t0 test. It explains why m0st 0f the angles in the charts thr0ugh0ut this b00k are cust0m angles. Clearly my m0st frequently used are 4S°, 0°, I8O°, 72°, and I44°. But n0ne 0f these angles w0uld be appr0priate f0r 0uter planets because they m0ve s0 sl0wly. In this case we can sub- divide the transit angles further using the Law 0f Vibrati0n vect0r matrix. As an example y0u sh0uld l00k at Uranus 2°30’ 0n the British P0und Sterling/US d0llar (GBPUSD) in Figure 23.4. Why every 2°30’ transit m0vement fr0m Aries 0°? Keep in mind that the last may n0t be 2°30’ as it resets at Aries 2°30” each r0tati0n. If y0u want t0 increase every separati0n by 2°30’ y0u w0uld use a different t00l in Optuma called “Time by Planetary Degrees.” Uranus tracks the GBPUSD with a fact0r 0f 5. 1 simply divided it by 2 t0 retain the vect0r integrity. A single transit angle 0r an angle fr0m a defined date called a natal transit is an imp0rtant measurement t0 c0nsider in y0ur w0rk.

C. PLANETARY ASPECTS

Grab a c0ffee; we are 90ing t0 be here awhile 0n this t0pic ab0ut Aspects. An aspect is the angular relati0nship between tw0 planets, 0r between a planet and an aster0id 0r s0lar system reference p0int like the Galactic center. It is just an angular measurement between the tw0 b0dies.

T0 repeat f0r ease 0f finding the symb0ls f0r angles 0f separati0n:

Figure 23.Sa is a daily chart 0f the D0w J0nes Industrial Average. It was a w0rking chart sent t0 dients int0 the Oct0ber market high in 20I8. It was then p0sted Oct0ber 11th 0n LinkedIn when the DJIA fell t0 24,899. Clients were wamed that the price l0w rec0rded in Figure 23.Sa c0uld n0t h0ld based 0n the wave c0unt and pr0p0rti0ns within the dedine seen in intraday data. The next Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne was l0cated at 24,438. When the DJIA fell t0 the next maj0r supp0rt z0ne we did n0t have a Gann Time Fact0r. Theref0re, the breakd0wn unf0lding was still inc0mplete. Eventually price and Time Fact0rs met t0 create a key reversal b0tt0m and the DJIA d0sed ab0ve the c0nfluence z0ne. Was this the final b0tt0m? N0. As we w0rk thr0ugh the meth0ds behind these calculati0ns in future chapters it appears the markets will give us ample 0pp0rtunity t0 see real-time examples 0f an interim c0unter-trend swing up and a new market swing d0wn.

H0w c0uld 1 suspect that this will devel0p in the m0nths ahead? The vertical wide bands in Figure 23.Sa 0ver the price data are pr0ducing tremend0us timing results. There are five in the series and we have 0nly experienced the first three as sh0wn in the current daily DJIA chart. The f0urth cyde is just peaking 0n the far-right edge 0f the chart. It falls near the end 0f 20I8 when this b00k will be in pr0ducti0n and 0ut 0f my hands. The fifth cyde beat in this series will 0ccur in 20I9. 1 pr0mise t0 p0st the chart at 32ndJewel.c0m s0 we can all see what transpires with this cyde. 1 think it will pr0ve t0 be imp0rtant. What are these cydes? Natal Sun aspects mean that the cyde beat was set t0 begin at the January 20I8 high, n0t Aries 0°. Then 1 am tracking the Sun’s retum t0 the angles at 9O°, I8O°, and 36O°. The Sun’s retum t0 these selected angles is written ‘Natal Sun-Sun’. Then l00k in the chart t0 find the exact angle 0f the culminati0n. Y0u will find in the chart the glyph f0r Sun and the aspect symb0ls f0r square, 0pp0siti0n, and c0njuncti0n marking a full retum. Figure 23.Sa als0 sh0ws a Sun- Mercury Cyde creating a c0nfluence z0ne 0f Time Fact0rs. Regardless 0f y0ur flav0r 0f analysis, technical and fundamental meth0ds b0th bec0me m0re accurate when we kn0w the time fact0r 0r cydes t0 pair with them. N0tice the divergence in the C0mp0site Index t0 price int0 the market high. The C0mp0site n0t 0nly diverged at the high, but it was testing its 0wn m0ving average. (Simple I3 and 33 SMA 0n the C0mp0site described in Chapter 5.) N0w the 0s- cillat0r is at the b0tt0m 0f the screen nearly at the same displacement that f0rmed in the week 0f February 9. That means fr0m the Oct0ber market p0siti0n there will be a c0ns0lidati0n t0 lift the C0mp0site Oscillat0r 0ff the fl00r 0f the chart. Fr0m a higher level the DJIA can then start the next maj0r swing d0wn. Add the time fact0rs, add the directi0nal signal key reversal, the d0se back ab0ve resistance,

the c0mpleted Elli0tt Wave structure... and y0u have the idea h0w this all fits t0gether. Where is the previ0us f0urth wave within the larger rally? The DJIA c0ns0lidati0n that devel0ped August 4, 20I7 t0 September 8, 20I7. The price range is fr0m 22,I6S d0wn t0 2I,6OO. 1’m n0t saying we will 90 that l0w as 1 cann0t tell fr0m where we are n0w. But the critical inf0rmati0n will c0me fr0m the b0unce that is s00n t0 f0ll0w. Only then can we put th0se last pieces 0f the puzzle t0gether with the help 0f 0ther gl0bal indexes. S0 we will see what happens as 1 write the next chapters.

1 left this chapter awhile t0 w0rk 0n s0me 0f the fr0nt chapters and Elli0tt Wave. It was dear fr0m that last discussi0n that 1 needed t0 indude s0me guidance 0n the Elli0tt Wave Principle as 1 keep using it in my analysis with Gann. When 1 was d0ne and retumed, the chart in Figure 23.Sb revises the pri0r Figure 23.Sa chart t0 the current data 0n N0vember 9, 20I8. We see we have devel0ped a healthy b0unce and the C0mp0site 0scillat0r is near the m0mentum highs 0f the 0ld peaks seen in the hist0rical swings 0f the 0scillat0r. 1 still maintain in my rep0rt f0r dients that this is a c0rrective rally and will n0t end well f0r all the hedge fund managers jumping in. Only time will tell, but n0t all the time aspects and angles 1 was using in Oct0ber where displayed in chart 23.S4. N0w that we have a critical b0unce unf0lding in the DJIA, we need a m0re c0mplete list 0f the time cydes 1 am using which are sh0wn in Figure 23.Sb. They are as f0ll0ws:

Aspects: * Mars—Satum c0njuncti0n Heli0centric * Venus—Satum c0njuncti0n 0r 0pp0siti0n Heli0centric * Venus—Jupiter c0njuncti0n 0r 0pp0siti0n Heli0centric

* Venus—Plut0 c0njuncti0n 0r 0pp0siti0n Heli0centric

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

* Venus—Mars c0njuncti0n 0r 0pp0siti0n Heli0centric

* Venus—Uranus c0njuncti0n 0r 0pp0siti0n Heli0centric

* Sun square Natal Mercury Ge0centric

* Sun 0pp0siti0n 0r c0njunct Natal Sun Ge0centric (exact 0pp0siti0n Oct 2, 20I8 with the market t0p)

* Sun square Natal Sun Ge0centric

* Sun c0njuncti0n Natal Mercury

Angles: * Mercury Ge0centric 6O°

* M00n I20° Ge0centric

The charts c0ntain tw0 ways t0 start the angular separati0n mea- surement between planets. We can use Aries 0° as the start, 0r we can select a specific time ass0ciated with a price piv0t which we believe was significant. When y0u pick y0ur 0wn time reference it is called a natal calculati0n and all planet angle relati0nships are c0mpared t0 this date 90ing f0rward. There will be n0 aspects marked behind the natal date in y0ur data. The Sun c0njunct Natal Sun and Sun c0njunct Natal Mercury start date was March 29, 20I8 if y0u wish t0 c0py this chart t0 y0ur 0wn c0mputer. When Aries 0° is used y0u will pl0t the recurring selected angles 0f separati0n thr0ugh the entire hist0ry 0f y0ur data.

There is a cirde in Figure 23.Sa and 23.Sb 0n the price l0w 0f Oct0ber 29, 20I8. It is an ephemeris t0 sh0w a fast snap-sh0t 0f planet aspects 0n that day. But this ephemeris has an0ther purp0se. It is placed 0n the price level that aligns t0 a Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne 0f supp0tt. Later we will place the ephemeris 0ver a Gann c0nfluence z0ne after we c0ver h0w t0 use Gann’s Wheels. N0tice the ephemeris has a d0llar sign 0n the ring with planet glyphs. The d0llar sign represents

---

23. Less0n Three: Angles, Aspects, Trend Durati0n, and Harm0nic Angles

the price that we c0nverted t0 a l0ngitude value, s0 we can pl0t it like a planet. That way a price can be used like a planet t0 0bserve any aspect relati0nship that f0rms with the 0ther glyphs. The d0llar sign 0verlaps the Neptune glyph in Figure 23.Sb indicating that a c0n- juncti0n between price and Neptune is near 0r in 0rb. The way t0 kn0w is t0 l00k at the specific angles f0r each. 1 just m0ve my m0use 0ver the ephemeris f0r a detailed listing. Price was at 11° Pisces 0’. Chapter 28 will explain f0r y0u h0w t0 put price int0 an ephemeris. We als0 step thr0ugh this when we examine Gann’s C0ffee Letter. Neptune was p0siti0ned at I3° Pisces S4’ ge0centric. A c0njuncti0n was in 0rb between Price—Neptune.

Did y0u n0tice there is a cr0ss in the ephemeris in Figure 23.Sb? The cr0ss is sh0wing us that there are tw0 0pp0siti0ns. When there are numer0us astr0n0mical events in this little ephemeris t00l 1 like t0 see the inf0rmati0n in a different s0ftware pr0gram. Figure 23.6 is the s0ftware package called S0larFire. Y0u need t0 set the exact l0- cati0n because this pr0gram d0es n0t make the aspect calculati0ns t0 the center 0f the Earth. (0r maybe 1 d0n’t kn0w h0w t0 change it as the pr0gram seems t0 d0 everything but make c0ffee.) Figure 23.6 is the astr0n0mical ephemeris f0r Oct0ber 29, 20I8. 1 f0r90t t0 change the time t0 n00n and captured the current time when 1 created the chart at 8:30 p.m. We'll live with it as is. In general, y0u want t0 use Chica90’s CME f0r the 5&PsSOO and the NYSE l0cati0n 0nly if y0ur f0cus is primarily 0n st0cks. The pr0gram has the c00rdinates pre- defined f0r us. Just select them fr0m a wind0w.

The astr0n0mical events in Figure 23.6 reveal f0ur square 0r 9O° aspects and tw0 0pp0siti0ns, three planets separated by 72°s and 0ne I44° aspect. There are three trine aspects. The tighter the culminati0n t0 being exact, the m0re the line is s0lid heavy black. A s0lid line that

is light and thin is waxing t0ward being exact. The d0ts are aspects waning 0r beginning t0 separate after being exact. The s0lid black lines w0uld be viewed as having a greater weighting. Why s0 many aspects that we cann0t see in the Optuma ephemeris? Orb settings, 0r the slippage all0wed fr0m being exact alignments will vary 0n the s0ftware y0u use. Timing S0luti0n, Optuma, and S0larFire all have different ideas ab0ut the default t0 use. Check it. Figure 23.6 uses a wider t0lerance than we sh0uld all0w. Figure I8.9 is where the aspect strength 0r influence 0f an event was tested f0r a syn0dic cyde.

In Figure 23.6, the b0tt0m left frame is a rep0rt 1 ran t0 answer the questi0n, “Will these aspects 0ccur again next year in 20I9 and where in the z0diac?” As an example, l00king at the first r0w we find Uranus in the sec0nd harm0nic (Taurus) square the N0rth N0de in *(5)’ 0r the fifth harm0nic 0n February 2S, 20I9. Each c0lumn in this small table is explained bel0w.

N0w it has been a l0ng time since we discussed this, s0 let me repeat. Y0u can use a z0diac sign 0r write the name such as Aries, Taurus, Gemini, 0r y0u can use a number as sh0rt-hand called the h0use number 0r the harm0nic number 0ne thr0ugh twelve. The name harm0nic is n0t music 0r spherical math. Uranus defined in the first c0lumn 0n the first line is in the 2nd harm0nic that we kn0w is Taurus within the z0diac. That explains the ‘(H)’ label f0r c0lumn 2 with the entry (2) 0n the first line. It takes very little time t0 bec0me c0mf0rtable switching between different pr0grams with different n0- tati0n systems. The third c0lumn is the aspect symb0l. The f0urth c0lumn labelled ‘P2’ is the sec0nd planet glyph. The fifth c0lumn is the harm0nic p0siti0n 0f the sec0nd planet. The date is when the aspect will culminate next year.

23. Less0n Three: Angles, Aspects, Trend Durati0n, and Harm0nic Angles

as Uranus in the 2nd Harm0nic in 0pp0siti0n t0 Venus in the 8th Harm0nic and Jupiter (8) c0njunct Mercury (8); these are cydes y0u may want t0 put emphasis 0n after further evaluati0n. Neptune in the I2th harm0nic is trine M00n in the 4th Harm0nic; that has added significance f0r a market with similar vibrati0ns. But we need t0 kn0w h0w t0 test aspects separately t0 make these p0ssible weightings within similar aspects better defined in 0ur chart w0rk. The steps f0r examining these will be the same as f0r angles in a set defined bel0w.

Gann and Luther Jensen tell us that the main angles 0f separati0n t0 track between planets are 0°, 4S°, 6O°, I8O°, 36O°, and then the trines at 6O°, I20° and 24O°. Creating these calculati0ns manually between all planets is an extra0rdinary am0unt 0f w0rk. T0day we d0 n0t have such limitati0ns. In fact, these may n0t always be the best angles 0f separati0n if we test them f0r market c0rrelati0ns against all angles fr0m 0ne t0 36O.

D. STEPS FOR TESTING AN ASPECT CULMINATION

Asa member 0f the Educati0n C0mmittee f0r the Intemati0nal Fed- erati0n 0f Technical Analysts, 1 am aware 0f the required b00ks we have rec0mmended f0r the preparati0n 0f the CFTe 1 and 11 exams. (Visit IFTA.0rg) R0bert Pard0’s b00k? was said t0 be very heavy in c0mputer pr0gramming skills, and f0r the Spring 20I9 syllabus we replaced it with H0ward B. Bandy’s b00k Quantitative Trading Systems, Practical Meth0ds f0r Design, Testing, and Validati0n.* B0th

auth0rs are excellent and use a standard meth0d called walk f0rward analysis t0 verify trading systems. Their use 0f termin0l0gy is c0n- sistent between 0ne an0ther. Please refer t0 these b00ks, as 1 am d0ing n0w f0r this secti0n. 1 am n0t a statistician; as a result 1 am always leaming s0mething new and using reference b00ks as needed with each test and evaluati0n in a real-time envir0nment. 1 d0 n0t think we ever st0p leaming.

Let us test all the Heli0centric aspect angles 0f separati0n between Mercury and Venus fr0m 0ne t0 36O°. Figure 23.7 is a m0nthly 5&PSOO chart with a linear cyde 0verlay 0f all the angles 0f sep- arati0n between Mercury and Venus. Here’s the first trap. This is a hard chart t0 create when Timing S0luti0n is being used f0r the first time. One tends t0 feel a maj0r acc0mplishment has been realized just because y0u managed t0 input the c0rrect variables int0 the pr0gram t0 generate any graph. The trap is t0 jump right in and think, “W0w this graph needs t0 be sm00thed, but the l0ws 0f this cyde seem t0 match the price l0ws.” The pr0blem is that we d0 n0t kn0w anything ab0ut this cyde at this p0int and sh0uld n0t be assuming anything. In fact, this cyde with further testing has value, but appears t0 be inverted when we dig further. That is why 1 use Timing S0luti0n t0 evaluate a cyde but in the final steps m0ve it int0 an Optuma chart with a much better graphic display. 1 want 0nly the date 0f the culmi- nati0n tested 0ver the price bar with0ut all the n0ise and 0scillati0ns Timing S0luti0n generates. In Figure 23.7 the line pl0t 0ver the price data is 0nly the separati0n between Mercury and Venus. But we will n0t want all the angles 0f separati0n between Mercury and Venus as m0st 0f them are n0t meaningful. Where d0 we begin?

A better display w0uld be t0 graph the 0rbital path 0f separati0n between Mercury and Venus and let the c0mputer detect the angles

0f separati0n we sh0uld test. Take the subjective c0mp0nent away. Figure 23.8 is the graph 0f planet separati0n 0ver the full 36O° 0rbit r0tati0n 0ver a peri0d 0f I44.S7 days when the planets retum t0 their 0riginati0n p0siti0n 0r syn0d retum. In Figure 23.8 the dashed vertical lines mark the standard aspect angles between the planets at c0n- juncti0n, sextile, square, trine, 0pp0siti0n, trine, square, sextile, and back t0 c0njuncti0n.

In Figure 23.8 we can see that the c0mputer identified the cyde peri0d 0f I44.S7 days. There are f0ur cydes displayed averaging 4 different data intervals t0 create the cyde pr0file fr0m 4O years t0 3 years. The latter and sh0rtest near-by interval tells us if the cyde is still active in near-term data c0mpared t0 the results in the entire data set. What catches my eye is the black bar just ahead 0f the 0pp0siti0n angle that falls between 158° and I64°.

When 1 is0late that range in the graph, Timing S0luti0n creates a left-side margin descript0r that states the f0ll0wing: 158°3I’ t0 I63°38” experienced 9 market advances up and n0 dedines resulting in 100% rallies. It l00ks impressive, but 0nly nine 0ccurrences in 157 cyde repeats is n0t as exciting as it first appears. H0wever, in c0mparis0n, the culminati0n between Mercury and Venus near I8O° 0nly expe- rienced 5 market advances and 3 dedines. We need t0 kn0w m0re ab0ut the aspects between these tw0 planets.

Figure 23.9 repeats the steps ab0ve with a much wider data set. Fr0m the display in Figure 23.8 the c0mputer can be asked t0 generate an Efficiency Test. This gives us an idea 0f h0w the 5&P SOO trended fr0m zer0, being the p0int 0f culminati0n f0r a selected aspect, c0mpared t0 IO bars bef0re and after. The culminati0n 1 tested was the 0pp0siti0n between Mercury and Venus. The bars under the line chart display the number 0f 0ccurrences 0f market advances (upper bars) versus

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

market dedines (l0wer bars), with zer0 being the aspect in exact 0rb and then ten bars bef0re and after the exact culminati0n 0f the aspect.

The results in the right-side margin tabulate a win/l0ss evaluati0n. But n0t much happens at ‘0’ if we are l00king f0r tuming p0ints. This is just a c0ntinuati0n 0f the trend and the win/l0ss rati0 reflects the same idea.

Our real 90al is t0 repeat an example in Chapter I8. We want t0 define an aspect that has the ability t0 f0recast tuming p0ints in the market. N0w 0ne aspect al0ne d0es n0t make a m0del, but each c0mp0nent sh0uld have merit that stands 0n its 0wn. The f0recast in Figure I8.2d fav0red a c0ntinued market advance t0ward a peak in Oct0ber 0f 20I8. Chapter I8 was written in August 0f 20I8 and the screen capture was current at that time. It was p0sted 0n LinkedIn. 1 p0sted charts 0n LinkedIn t0 time-stamp them f0r later purp0ses in this b00k. N0w that 1 am writing in N0vember (... still!), we kn0w that the f0recast was c0rrect fr0m this m0del because the 5&PSOO experienced a sharp dedine beginning fr0m a market high in early Oct0ber 0f 20I8. But t0 test every idea and devel0p a m0del in this manner w0uld be time l0st and an inefficient way t0 d0 it. Theref0re, we need a standardized appr0ach t0 test a cyde’s f0recasting ability.

If we tell the c0mputer that the end 0f 0ur data is in 20O8, it cann0t see the data we can see n0w in 20I8. Let the c0mputer make a f0recast f0r 20O9 t0 20IO, then see h0w well it d0es int0 its future. As this is still in 0ur past we can evaluate the results. Repeat this step f0rward an0ther year, then reevaluate. We d0 n0t want 0ur faith in the m0del’s value t0 be based 0n past perf0rmance, but rather 0n kn0wing h0w well it perf0rms with future data which the c0mputer cann0t see. N0w we have m0re reliable 0pini0ns 0f h0w well it may d0. This appr0ach t0 testing is called “Walk F0rward Analysis.”

C0mparing price t0 a f0recast line is a measurement 0f c0rrelati0n (r). When ‘r’ equals +1 the f0recast was a perfect match t0 the actual price acti0n that later devel0ped. When ‘r’ equals —1 it is a perfect inverted relati0nship t0 price m0vement. If the c0rrelati0n is zer0, we are t0ast, because we have f0und a cyde that is t0tally rand0m with useless f0recast capabilities c0mpared t0 the market acti0n.

This range fr0m —1 t0 +1 is called the Pears0n c0rrelati0n c0ef- ficient and 0ffers a way f0r us t0 c0mpare the similarity 0f the tw0 variables, in this case 0ur 5&PSOO market t0 the angles 0f separati0n between Mercury and Venus Heli0centric. The c0efficient is the c0- variance, 0r similarity, 0f the tw0 divided by the pr0duct 0f their standard deviati0ns. In English, we want 100% 0r +1, but will never get it. Plus, we want it t0 be perfect all the time, but it is never 90ing t0 happen. Realize we will accept less than perfecti0n. S0me pe0ple find the perfect fit within a small wind0w 0f their data and pr0daim the value 0f their m0del. 1 cann0t tell y0u the number 0f papers sub- mitted f0r c0nsiderati0n t0 the CMA’s J0umal that 1 pers0nally tested, 0nly t0 find their m0dels w0rk in 0ne market directi0n 0nly. M0st failed when evaluated in a bear market. 1 have seen this in black-b0x system descripti0ns within pr0spectus d0cuments. There are l0ts 0f ways t0 falsify the apparent value. Pers0nally, 1 will never supp0rt a black-b0x appr0ach t0 trading, but 1 d0 believe this is a valuable guide f0r research purp0ses t0 leam as much as p0ssible ab0ut c0mp0nents we add t0 0ur chart w0rk.

Fr0m Figure 23.8 when 0ur results just gave us a quick 0verview, the next step is t0 create 0ne cyde as sh0wn in Figure 23.IO that we can evaluate further. The real questi0n we want t0 ask is if this cyde can f0recast.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

Figure 23.11 sh0ws a peri0d 0f time fr0m September 20O6 t0 the end 0f 20O8. The chart has a line-0n-d0se with price bars as high-l0w rectangles. The pr0gram’s graphics l00k very DOS-like, but it’s very usable f0r research purp0ses. The ‘candles’ are very funky as they were created 0ver a line-0n-d0se, but y0u can distinguish price versus the pr0jecti0n lines. There are f0ur pr0jecti0n lines: the black line, marked ‘A’ is a pr0jecti0n line fr0m ab0ut 4O years 0f I44.S7 cydes; the first dark shade 0f gray marked ‘B’ is a pr0jecti0n based 0n just the last 3 years 0f cydes; ‘C’ is the f0recast derived fr0m I6 years; and the last, a faint thin gray n0t labeled is the last 7 years 0f prices used t0 create a f0recast.

If 1 scr0ll f0rward in Figure 23.11 t0 N0vember 20I8, the f0recast c0ntinues 0n int0 the future. The f0ur f0recasts d0 n0t all agree. Which f0recasts were in f0rce in 20O8 thr0ugh 20I2? F0recasts ‘A’ and ‘C, the 4O-year and I6-year data range f0recasts. The three-year is imp0rtant because it tells me the cyde is still active, but it inverts in 20I9 and 2020. When 1 l00k back at 20O8, the 3-year f0recast in- verted then as well. ‘A, ‘C; and unmarked ‘D’ are all in agreement.

Next, 1 rem0ve the f0recasts fr0m my screen and retum back t0 the data display. While trying t0 match similarities, 1 realize that 1 can have my c0mputer search the past t0 find when a similar pattem 0ccurred, Figure 23.I2 is the result, and 1 leam that a similarity 0c- curred fr0m April 0f I997 with ‘r’ equal t0 0.972, an extremely high c0rrelati0n, and again in I987 beginning September 0f I987 when ‘r’ equaled 0.96S. With this anal0gy defined, what is the pr0jecti0n 90ing f0rward?

Figure 23.I3 sh0ws the pattem: a sharp dedine t0ward the end 0f 20O2. Bel0w the x-axis is a sec0nd x-axis fr0m 20I7 t0 2024. It wams that a similar pattem c0uld devel0p fr0m 202I int0 2023. Y0u will

want t0 make a n0te 0f this t0 add t0 the cumulative inf0rmati0n we are gathering regarding this peri0d.

Luse a filter that all0ws me t0 search similar pattems f0r the Mercury cyde and then the Venus cyde. The charts l00k similar t0 Figure 23.I3 with a t0p shift in time devel0ping, but the d0wntrend remains c0nsistent f0r b0th. The peri0d fr0m 20OO t0 20O3 is impressive.

N0w we want t0 90 back t0 the astr0n0mical events between Mercury and Venus. The h0t z0ne 1 f0und in Figure 23.8 was 0nly a preliminary evaluati0n. There are 0ther pr0gram steps rec0mmended by the vend0r, and the c0mputer defines my cyde as needing im- pr0vement. The highest degree 0f predictability is when Mercury and Venus are separated by 20O° t0 2IO°.

Figure 23.I4 sh0ws the black bar just ab0ve I9O° t0 2IO°. A little m0re testing narr0ws it t0 20O° t0 2IO°. This means the I8O° 0pp0siti0n in my chart as a Time Fact0r will be 0ff as a Tuming P0int 0r Gann Time Fact0r. Gann has defined an im- p0rtant aspect, but using the t00ls we have available t0day we can impr0ve its value. N0w 1 am ready t0 switch s0ftware vend0rs t0 Optuma t0 create a chart with the final cust0m aspect we just defined.

Figure 23.15 is the finished cust0m aspect cyde added t0 the weekly 5&P SOO chart. What w0uld my dients have seen in my public charts? They w0uld have seen the 0pp0siti0n aspect between Mercury and Venus at I8O°. The cust0m aspect w0uld have been kept f0r my private w0rk and analysis preparati0ns f0r them. F0r years pe0ple have c0pied my charts and w0ndered why my target dates were a tad different when the cydes were c0pied int0 their 0wn c0mputers by users 0f the same s0ftware. N0w y0u kn0w. 1 never sh0wed everything.

4S3

The task is well-started but n0t c0mplete. We still must find dusters 0f aspects 0r astr0n0mical events, s0 that we kn0w when t0 filter a single aspect 90ing astray fr0m 0ur decisi0n criteria. We can l00k at this next.

E. TIME FACTOR CLUSTERS AND TREND DURATION

If we add t0 0ur weekly 5&PsSOO chart a Venus Retr0grade cyde, we w0uld be in a better p0siti0n t0 f0rm a c0rrect 0pini0n than s0me0ne with 0nly the aspect as sh0wn in Figure 23.15. Figure 23.I6 impr0ves the results, sh0wing h0w adding 0ne additi0nal astr0n0mical cyde can make a very big difference f0r us.

Figure 23.I7 is the same 5&P SOO weekly chart, but adds a third astr0n0mical event, an angle f0r Satum transiting every 9° (Heli0- centric). Why Satum 9°? (9, I8, 36, 72, I44...) Why Satum? We are appr0aching a bear market and Satum is a maj0r player. These number series apply t0 angles, calendar day/bar c0unts, 0r ge0metric pr0p0rti0ns. In a weekly chart y0u will rarely see Satum stati0ned at 72° due t0 the time it takes t0 transit fr0m 0ne stati0n t0 the next. Theref0re, sh0rten the same cyde interval by using the Law 0f Vi- brati0n number bel0w 72 that is 0n that same vect0r.

N0t all dusters 0f astr0n0mical events sh0uld be viewed as equal in imp0rtance. D0 n0t use t00ls that attempt t0 pl0t astr0n0mical dusters f0r y0u. Kn0w the aspect first as an individual event, and then within a duster s0 that y0u can 0bserve the frequency with which a similar gathering 0ccurs. N0ne 0f this is p0ssible in a t00l that gives y0u a bar graph.

23. Less0n Three: Angles, Aspects, Trend Durati0n, and Harm0nic Angles

Ge0centric Satum transit 15°, Plut0 Retr0grade, Ge0 Venus c0njuncti0n, 0pp0siti0n, trine Jupiter, Ge0 Sun I44° Plut0, Ge0 Sun c0njuncti0n, trine, sextile, and 0pp0siti0n Ceres, and Sun I44 Mars.

Figure 23.I8 als0 has f0ur 0vals marking dusters near labels ‘A? “B, ‘C; and ‘E.’ Area ‘D’ in the chart is t0 aid the descripti0n f0r ‘E’’

When a duster 0f astr0n0mical events gather as marked by ‘A’... RUN! Find an0ther market. The pattem will bec0me a c0ntracting triangle 0r w0rse and n0 0ne wins. A trend will n0t retum until the last astr0n0mical event 0f the c0ngested duster. Be very careful 0f the last statement. Immediately after ‘A’ we can see a sharp d0wn swing int0 supp0rt. That was the resumpti0n 0f the larger d0wntrend. It was n0t a reversal t0 end the dedine. Over the years 1 have dis- c0vered pe0ple always assume a price reversal. That w0uld be a seri0us misunderstanding. The awareness 0f astr0n0mical dusters was the first m0st valuable indicat0r 1 0bserved because it wamed me when t0 keep 0ut 0f a market. N0 0ther technical t00l 0r meth0d exists t0 give us this waming. In additi0n, markets run freely fr0m 0ne astr0n0mical event t0 the next when there are n0 r0adbl0cks (a r0adbl0ck being a Time Fact0r 0f different aspects defining a duster between the primary 0nes that we kn0w the market is tracking). Think 0f it as vertical resistance. The str0ngest trending m0ves devel0p when there is a v0id and n0 time fact0rs 0f significance are present. We see this in the data after ‘A’. The min0r cydes between ‘A’ and ‘B’ just cause the market t0 pause bef0re the str0ng trend resumes int0 ‘BY

The duster at ‘C’ is similar but 0f greater imp0rtance because the duster 0f events gather when price is just under a 4S° angled trendline. The image y0u see at ‘C’ sh0uld be etched in y0ur mind. This is im-

46I

p0rtant. ‘D’ is in the future and wams that this is 90ing t0 be a ch0ppy directi0nless time interval f0r this market. ‘E’ is when it dears. Y0u will never kn0w if it is a t0p 0r b0tt0m. Y0u will kn0w if y0u kn0w the Elli0tt Wave Principle and have a s0lid c0mmand 0f c0nven- ti0nal technical analysis skills. Gann analysis cann0t and will n0t replace c0nventi0nal meth0ds. They c0mplement 0ne an0ther. F0r this reas0n, 1 always rec0mmend leaming dassic technical analysis first bef0re y0u enter the w0rld 0f Gann. The Square 0f the Range is in Figure 23.I8. N0tice the market stayed bel0w a descending angle fr0m the c0mer 0f the square. It n0w is b0uncing up fr0m the 50% divider 0f the square marking supp0rt. There are n0 time fact0rs, s0 the market is at risk t0 track the 4S-degree trendline back d0wn at a steeper angle f0r a peri0d.

F. SQUARING THE LONGITUDE TO DEFINE A CUSTOM ASPECT ANGLE

S0me 0f the advanced Gann readers will see this segment title and think, “Say, what?” Gann was s0 creative with his use 0f squares that 1 tried new ideas t0 push the envel0pe as well and stumbled 0n 0ne 1 use f0r the 5&PS0OO. 1 have n0t tried 0r tested the c0ncept in 0ther markets.

Here’s h0w it 90es... Place an ephemeris t00l at the exact price level 0f a maj0r swing in a daily chart. The price bar 1 selected is the market high 0n the far left side 0f the chart. N0w read the l0ngitude p0siti0n 0f the Sun 0n that day. The price high in Figure 23.I9 0n this day p0siti0ns the Sun at 306.15° l0ngitude. Then take the square r00t 0f 306.15 which equals I7.5. The chart sh0ws a Time Fact0r just

---

t0 the left 0f the same market high--a s0lar retum where the glyphs mark Sun c0njunct Sun.

The chart was very difficult t0 mark s0 let’s take this 0ne sl0wly.

‘A’ in Figure 23.I9 is my eff0rt t0 c0nnect f0r y0u the Sun L0n- gitude 0f 306.15° label t0 its l0ngitude placement within the circular ephemeris centered 0n the market high. N0w take the square r00t 0f 306 and it equals I7.5. Next, use the result 0f I7.5° t0 define the cust0m aspect. The thin arr0w ‘B’ c0nnects the I7.5 label at the t0p 0f the screen t0 the aspect in the chart sh0wing Sun I7.5 Sun. The cust0m angle 0f I7.5° is a midp0int 0f a 35° interval sh0wing that this, t00, was n0t astr0l0gy related. We are just using astr0n0mical calcu- lati0ns. The cust0m angle, in this example I7.5°, is always 0btained fr0m the l0ngitude when we t00k the square r00t 0f 306.

N0w fr0m the market b0tt0m, there is a sec0nd ephemeris in place 0n the b0tt0m 0f the key reversal. On this exact day the l0ngitude 0f Mars was 248.2S. A black arr0w p0ints t0 Mars in the small ephemeris, as a c0njuncti0n with the M00n directly 0n t0p 0f the Mars glyph is making it hard t0 read. Mars is stati0ned at 248.2S°. N0w take the square r00t 0f 248.2S and create a new aspect using 15.7° with Mars. The aspect and planet pairing 1 selected was Mercury 15.7 Mars. This cust0m aspect calls several piv0ts in the rally that f0ll0ws. M0re im- p0rtantly it calls the Oct0ber 20I8 high. The aspect marks 0ne bar t0 the right after the market t0p. It is n0t the first market high but the sec0nd price high that defines the d0uble t0p. N0tice the first t0p d0es n0t sh0w a Mars 15.7 Mercury aspect. It 0nly culminates 0n the sec0nd t0p. When the price l0w 0r high that was used t0 create the angle fr0m the square r00t 0f a l0ngitude is br0ken, then the cust0m angle is n0 l0nger used and it is rem0ved fr0m the chart.

G. H0w t0 Make Pr0fits in C0mm0dities—THE I94I VERSUS I9j}11 EDITIONS

The I94I release 0f H0w t0 Make Pr0fits in C0mm0dities is perhaps the m0st difficult b00k t0 find by Gann. 1 f0und a c0py in Germany when 1 started t0 search the title using different languages. The c0py set me back $7,SOO. When it arrived, 1 underst00d why the c0st was s0 high. The b00k was filled with hand and typed c0rrecti0ns 0n thin c0rrecti0n tape strips fitting neatly between the narr0w lines. S0meb0dy went t0 a l0t 0f tr0uble as the c0rrecti0ns are numer0us. Gann’s s0n J0hn was pictured in the I94I editi0n. He is n0t in the I942 editi0n n0r is he in the I9SI first 0r sec0nd editi0ns. In my I94I editi0n what caught my eye was written 0n the inside c0ver, “TOPS /32/ 0ver BTMS /334.” N0w if y0u are familiar with this b00k, y0u kn0w that the 0nly way any0ne is 90ing t0 kn0w that number c0unt w0uld be if s0me0ne t0ld them. If y0u have c0me this far, y0u kn0w Gann was a 33° Freemas0n and was the C0mmander 0f his L0dge in Br00klyn, New Y0rk. The level 0f highest training f0r the Sc0ttish Rite Freemas0n is the 32nd Jewel. The symb0l w0m ar0und a Free- mas0n’s neck in meetings is called a Jewel befitting the level 0f the craftsman. Theref0re, the written text had m0re than 0ne meaning that 1 underst00d immediately. Naturally the first questi0n is if it is true? Then that questi0n leads t0 0thers ab0ut the differences between the three editi0ns in I94I, I942, and I9SI. H0w d0 1 find the s0-called 32 T0ps t0 33 B0tt0ms? Where are they in the b00ks that list hundreds 0f time intervals? What are they? Is there a difference between re- leases? S0 many questi0ns, and 1 was dueless ab0ut h0w t0 begin. It was Patrick Mikula wh0 did all the w0rk at first. Independently we arrived at the same c0ndusi0n that percentages attributed t0 J0hn

Gann were used as a sm0ke screen. H0wever, in my 0pini0n there is an excepti0n. When Gann references 50% retracements, these are his, as he is c0nsistent thr0ugh0ut his materials, if n0t frustratingly s0, since the c0nsistencies all use the same 0dd language. Patrick then th0ught that all references that used the w0rd “Natural” were the key markers. On this 1 disagree. There are three ways Max Heindel used the w0rd “Natural.” Only when 1 realized that Gann used the vemacular 0f their day befitting the teachings 0f the Freemas0ns c0uld 1 then begin t0 make pr0gress. 1 als0 detected a pattem when a date c0ntained “natural” and a 50% 0r “0ne-half” reference. It was interesting that he far m0re 0ften used the written f0rm rather than the 50% f0rm. When we study Gann’s Hexa90n Wheel 1 will use very specific examples fr0m the b00k t0 sh0w y0u h0w Gann’s time targets were calculated. We will n0t get b0gged d0wn n0w with th0se details.

Let’s begin with a difference between the I94I editi0n versus the I9S2 editi0n.

The first example is a “bait-n-switch.” The I94I editi0n 0n page I30 lists Oct0ber S0ybeans. But in the descripti0n, Gann states I94I/O6/27 is the delivery date. It w0uld n0t be f0r Oct0ber beans. Gann m0ves 0n and then states, “N0te 15O is the natural Selling Level” and adds “Same date Dec beans s0ld 15O 1/4.” Gann is n0t talking ab0ut Oct0ber Beans, he is giving a date f0r December S0ybeans. What is s0 interesting ab0ut I94I/O6/27 that is 0ut 0f place?

anything 0ther than the 0bvi0us. My pr0blem is an Oct0ber c0ntract d0es n0t deliver in June as menti0ned. Yes, Gann makes y0u want t0 think everything is encrypted, especially after w0rking with Tunnel. 1 am n0t an “Ag” trader s0 maybe 1’m missing s0mething, but the delivery date reference d0es n0t bec0me the reas0n f0r the reference regardless.

It is very dear fr0m l00king at Wheat, C0m, and C0tt0n charts in Figures 23.20 t0 23.22 that 0pp0siti0ns play as big a r0le in the agri- culture markets t0day as they did f0r Gann. Then we want t0 start mapping the dates in Gann’s b00k. Figure 23.23 is called a bi-wheel, s0 we can visually see a c0mparis0n 0f tw0 planetary ephemerides 0n different dates. On the September I2, I94I date Gann sells S0ybeans. He states that it is the seas0nal high; we understand the imp0rtance 0f the seas0nal dates. The bi-wheel lay0ut sh0ws us that the September I2, I94I date is a c0nfirmati0n as Neptune, Sun, and the N0rth N0de are all stati0ned in the sixth harm0nic. Gann states the market is 0na “Natural Selling Level.” September I2 is an interesting date. It falls in the middle 0f these edipses:

In Appendix K y0u will find a list starting fr0m I8OO t0 2028 0f Lunar and S0lar Edipses all s0rted a few different ways. We can c0me back t0 this.

The N0rth and S0uth N0de p0siti0ns als0 catch my attenti0n in Figure 23.23. An extensive study will be made 0f the N0rth N0de and its z0diac p0siti0n much later. F0r n0w, let’s keep 90ing.

N0w the I9SI 2nd editi0n 0n page 15O references a S0ybean b0tt0m 0n September 2S, I9SO. This is s0 frustrating. 1 b0ught an 0lder c0py 0f the “revised” I9SI editi0n. It adds a table and a c0uple 0f charts. It d0es n0t add new dates 0r data bey0nd the I942 editi0n that 1 already 0wned. 1 then b0ught the sec0nd editi0n that has a reference t0 September 2S, I9SO. Just h0w many releases are there? 1’m up t0 f0ur. What’s s0 special ab0ut this date that Gann adds it t0 his sec0nd editi0n?

Lunar T0tal Sep26I9SO 4:21:2S AM — O2° Ar 30°S4”

Itis a T0tal Lunar edipse. That is very c00l Gann. 1 keep 0n mining thr0ugh the data and create a massive spreadsheet t0 help detect his pattems. Y0u will find a pattem where the w0rd ‘natural’ appears, which Patrick Mikula first picked up, and what 1 am adding is the term ‘half-way’ 0r 50%. All the 0ther percentages that his s0n calculated f0r the b00k mean n0thing. Y0u can delete all th0se dates and market n0tes. What y0u are left with is a list 0f planetary aspects repeated and applied in I94I and c0nfirmed as still valid in the I9SI sec0nd editi0n. Stray dates that seem c0nfusing are needed f0r making specific angular calculati0ns in Gann’s Wheels. We will c0ver this inf0rmati0n in detail in Chapter 29.

What ab0ut the edipses? 1 am just shy 0f finding the edipse ref- erences being tagged t0 32 t0ps and 33 b0tt0ms. 1 must have missed a c0uple al0ng the way. While S0lar and Lunar edipse cydes will be discussed in their 0wn chapter, this listing fills in the missing dates and pr0vides y0u with the I94I Editi0n Lunar and S0lar Edipses marked by the w0rd “natural” within the text.

H. ASPECTS IN THE I929 ANNUAL STOCK FORECAST

Gann’s I929 Annual St0ck F0recast has been used t0 pr0daim that he called the market high and l0w 0f the Great Crash. But 1 w0uld rather study it 0bjectively. Did he really make these calls? What stands 0ut as astr0n0mical events that c0uld help us t0day?

Figure 23.24 is the fr0nt page 0f Gann’s I929 Annual St0ck F0recast. It sh0ws the swings and the date 0r date range he expected a high 0r l0w in price. The chart that f0ll0ws in F igure 23.2S is a daily DJIA c0vering the year I929 with an ephemeris centered 0n the t0p 0f each price bar Gann defined as a pr0jected high. F0r price highs, in- duding the September 3rd market t0p, Gann d0es very well. We can see there are numer0us 0pp0siti0ns at each pr0jected high. S0me 0f the 0pp0siti0ns are t0 price; 0thers are planet culminati0ns 0f 0pp0- siti0n. The takeaway sh0uld be that the Opp0siti0n aspects are ex- tremely imp0rtant.

t0 his f0recast. The f0recast f0r l0ws is n0t great. Here the rum0r mill has 90ne 0verb0ard 0nly recalling the eventual b0tt0m years later that he d0es accurately f0recast. As this isa daily chart, was Gann l00king f0r a different type 0f astr0n0mical event? T0 answer this questi0n the reader is asked t0 be patient. We must c0ver Gann’s Hexa90n and Square 0f Nine. Then the reader will find 0ther reas0ns Gann selected the dates he used in his rep0rt.

Figure 23.27 is the I929 daily DJIA chart sh0wing m00n phases and s0lar and lunar edipses. The s0lid black cirdes are New M00n phases and always imp0rtant f0r the financial markets. We tested m00n phases in Chapter I8, and the chart that w0uld be 0f interest can be f0und in Figure I8.I3.

The cirde with a d0t in the center is a S0lar Edipse. The larger crescent m00n symb0l is a Lunar Edipse. We kn0w edipses were imp0rtant f0r Gann, and they will be 0ur f0cus 0f discussi0n in the next chapter. Gann’s f0cus was l00king f0r c0nfluence time intervals 0f astr0n0mical events.

1. FUTURES CONTRACT BAS15 ROLLOVER

When y0u trade st0cks, y0u must c0rrect y0ur data f0r st0ck splits, which is handled by y0ur data vend0r. But when y0u trade futures c0ntracts, it is up t0 y0u h0w y0u want t0 handle the basis spread between the c0ntracts r0lling 0ver t0 a new fr0nt m0nth. We all seem t0 handle this in different ways. Basis spread is the spread between the Cash and Futures markets. There is a difference because futures have what we call c0st 0f carry. In agriculture pr0ducts y0u have st0rage, transp0rtati0n (induding barge, vessel, and rail rates), and interest rate c0sts. These all c0ntribute t0 why there is a difference between

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

the Cash market and Futures c0ntract price. The c0ntract r0lling 0ff has limited added c0sts, while the new fr0nt c0ntract may have several m0nths 0f extra c0sts. This causes a gap in the data.

Figure 23.28 is the Nasdaq 100 Futures in a daily chart. There are three different c0ntracts: June 20I8, December 20I8, and the 0ne we will r0ll int0 s00n—the March 20I9 c0ntract. Financials d0 n0t have st0rage c0sts, but they d0 have interest rate risk exp0sure. When 0ne c0ntract is n0 l0nger the active c0ntract and the delivery date has passed, the v0lume is negligible. The data s00n l00ks like d0ts between numer0us gaps. The active c0ntract data is easy t0 identify in Figure 23.28 because it will l00k like a n0rmal series 0f 0-H-L-C bars within the chart. When 0ne c0ntract is trading int0 its delivery date and 0ff the b0ards, the new c0ntract c0ntains the greatest trading v0lume. The c0ntract r0lling 0ut is still trading because there are a series 0f days t0 n0tify, wam, and then demand delivery. This time spread between the date when the new c0ntract bec0mes the fr0nt and active market and when the 0ld is still available is an issue that has t0 be addressed. M0st pe0ple r0ll their data IO days ahead 0f the delivery date 0f the 0ld c0ntract. R0ll0vers are nasty plain and simple. 1 try t0 av0id the c0ntract r0ll0ver date when traders sell the 0ld and buy the new as an example. It is a very dirty market during this peri0d. The basis differential causes a gap in the data that is 0nly the basis spread. Y0u als0 need t0 recalculate all y0ur targets f0r the new c0ntract prices. Then h0w d0 we handle this gap?

Gann handled the pr0blem in tw0 ways that 1 am aware 0f. If he started charting a new c0ntract, we w0uld see it pl0tted right 0n the same chart as the 0ld with the price basis spread differential dearly visible in the chart as a parallel pl0t between the 0ld and new c0n- tracts. It d0es n0t impact date c0unts 0f maj0r piv0ts, but fan angles

23. Less0n Three: Angles, Aspects, Trend Durati0n, and Harm0nic Angles

have t0 be redrawn, and price 0bjectives redefined. That’s why y0u will find Gann charts 0n the web that l00k similar in s0me respects t0 Figure 23.28.

If Gann did n0t use the same chart page as the 0ld c0ntract, he w0uld keep a rec0rd and transfer the dates 0f the maj0r piv0ts fr0m the 0ld c0ntracts 0nt0 the new chart. The key piv0t time intervals never change.

There is an0ther way. Figure 23.29 is a c0ntinu0us c0ntract f0r just December S0ybean Oil. It keeps a c0nstant reference, and we have seen this in s0me 0f Gann’s charts. It keeps the basis pr0blem 0ut 0f the equati0n, but the data will n0t reflect the actual trading prices m0st 0f the time in the active fr0nt c0ntract. H0wever, it d0es all0w us t0 keep a true rec0rd 0f angles, ge0metric analysis, and bar c0unts fr0m key reversals 0n the chart with0ut having t0 red0 it every time the c0ntract r0lls 0ver. Figure 23.29 sh0ws three descending 4S° angles.

They remain valid thr0ugh0ut the chart regardless if December is the active c0ntract 0r n0t. Agriculture pr0ducts have very different Cash market data, s0 this meth0d is a 900d s0luti0n. 1 handle the pr0blem in the 5&PSOO, DJIA, and NASDAQ by using the Cash index f0r my analysis.

An0ther way 0f handling the gap between the r0ll0ver is t0 subtract the basis spread in the fr0nt c0ntract fr0m the c0ntract r0lling 0ut. Yes, it dist0rts the true price 0f the 0ld c0ntract. It gets w0rse as y0u must subtract the differential fr0m the entire price hist0ry. As we keep 0n subtracting the basis 0f the new c0ntract fr0m the entire data range, y0u will have s0me c0ntracts like the L0ng-B0nd and G0ld that will have price hist0ries that pl0t bel0w zer0. H0w y0u want t0 handle back-adjusting is c0mplex. Y0u need t0 research the pr0s and c0ns as there are several ways t0 handle the data.

Less0n F0ur: Trading S0lar and Lunar Edipses

C0nnie Br0wn {c} 32ndJewel.c0m

Ifthe M00n’s 0rbit was n0t tilted 5 degrees t0 Earth’s, we w0uld have a Lunar and S0lar Edipse every m0nth. F0rtunately, we d0 n0t.

L0ng a90 1 f0und that the edipses were squirrelly in a very early versi0n 0f the Market-Analyst s0ftware. This is the f0rmula 1 passed al0ng t0 fix the pr0blem. S0me0ne d0ing manual w0rk may want it as well.

An edipse is determined by l0ngitude, n0t dedinati0n. If the Sun 0r M00n is c0njunct 0r 0pp0siti0n AND (critical AND) the N0rth N0de is within 11.6 degrees 0f c0njunct 0r 0pp0siti0n, it is an edipse. It d0es n0t happen that 0ften because 0f the Earth’s tilt. There is always a shad0w, but it usually misses Earth. Similar alignment is required f0r the Lunar Edipse. We had a T0tal S0lar edipse pass right 0ver

my building last year in the summer. 1 was surprised it did n0t get as dark as 1 had th0ught “t0tal” w0uld mean. But it was d0wnright weird. The air was sp00ky still. All s0unds ceased as animals and birds went int0 hibemati0n s0mewhere. N0 cars were m0ving, as every0ne was at their sp0t t0 watch with eye pr0tecti0n. A small park in fr0nt 0f my building was filled with faceless pe0ple staring in my directi0n wearing black shades—all l00king very alien. 1 am in a st0ne building and just wanted t0 stay put. Markets flatlined. It was just plain weird, and 1 knew it was 0ver when cars started t0 r0ll again, and squirrels and birds began t0 stir.

regi0n can be c0rrelated t0 edipse events. This is n0t s0mething 1 have researched 0r have an 0pini0n 0n bey0nd saving a list 0f hist0ric earthquakes and their ge0graphic l0cati0ns. The site where y0u can find reliable event paths is fr0m NASA.’

A c0mplete listing 0f s0lar and lunar edipses can be f0und in Ap- pendix K which is s0rted by year, 0r by type, 0r by z0diac p0siti0n. 1 have used all three different listing s0rts at 0ne time 0r an0ther. The list starts in I8OO and extends t0 2028. The shad0w fr0m the s0lar edipse will impact different areas 0n Earth and s0me m0re s0 than 0thers.

Did y0u kn0w that edipses with the M00n can 0ccur with 0ther planets? Figure 24.3 sh0ws the map when an edipse between the M00n and Mars will f0rm a shad0w 0n Earth and its path. Have 1 ever tested it t0 see if this is a cyde w0rth m0nit0ring? N0. But 1 just wanted t0 r0ck y0ur w0rld with 0ther p0ssibilities y0u may n0t have kn0wn. They are 0ut there, and the Timing S0luti0n s0ftware has the capability t0 test any edipse y0u want t0 test. Per- s0nally, 1 just want t0 pay attenti0n t0 s0lar and lunar edipses as Gann did.

Gann dem0nstrates f0r us in Tunnel that the entry p0int is after the edipse. 1 was taught by Denny Myers regarding s0lar and lunar edipses and markets n0t t0 have all y0ur expectati0ns f0cused up0n the date 0f the edipse; rather, the f0cus sh0uld be 0n the market di- recti0n that devel0ps 0ut 0f an edipse. Why? Because, as he put it, the directi0n the “Indians run 0ut 0f the tent is the directi0n they can run f0r tw0 0r three m0nths.” N0w dearly that “scientific” descripti0n needed t0 be beefed-up a TAD. But testing pr0ved Gann and Denny

1. Visit http://edipse.gsfc.nasa.90v/edipse-html.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

t0 be c0rrect. Then 1 w0ndered h0w the peri0d bef0re and after the edipse cyde w0uld test.

1 began fr0m Denny’s wisd0m and started t0 test the markets in my m0re disciplined appr0ach. Figure 24.4 is 0ne study 0f the 5&PSOO and h0w it reacted t0 several s0lar edipses and the market reacti0n IO days bef0re and t0 days after. The zer0 vertical line is the edipse date. Here we see a stall int0 the edipse and a resumpti0n 0f the trend f0ll0ws. This is the average market m0vement 0ver a series 0f edipses in the data being studied. The faint line behind the darker sh0ws that the trend had a bad break with the general results 0f the study in the last f0ur nearby edipses. Y0u need t0 l00k right 0f the vertical zer0 line.

As 1 tested m0re markets and 0pened the wind0w t0 20 days bef0re and after the edipse, t0 my surprise Denny’s general and un0rth0d0x descripti0n was pr0ving t0 be c0rrect. H0wever, there was 0ne big difference. N0t every market ar0und the w0rld reacted similarly t0 s0lar and lunar edipses. S0me were m0re sensitive t0 lunar, the 0thers fav0red s0lar. Y0u will leam in Chapter 29 h0w t0 derive a price 0bjective using the Hexa90n Wheel in a s0lar and lunar edipse. H0wever, we can c0ntinue, as this applicati0n 0ffers a 900d intr0- ducti0n t0 the use 0f the 0uter dial 0f Gann’s Wheels with dates spaced ar0und the 0utside. There will als0 be an0ther ring that displays just the angles 0f the cirde.

“and when 1 shall put thee 0ut, 1 will c0ver the heaven, and make the stars there0f dark; 1 will c0ver the Sun with a d0ud [a S0lar Edipse], and the M00n shall n0t give her light [a Lunar Edipse].” R0bert underst00d _

Gann has a small err0r in Tunnel regarding the s0urce passage he was qu0ting in the King James Versi0n 0f the Bible. Gann references Ezekiel 33:2I but it is f0und in Ezekiel 33:7. The tw0 great edipses

0f I927 0ccur 0n June I4-15, I927 (T0tal Lunar), and June 29, I927 (T0tal S0lar).

Why d0es Gann fail t0 menti0n the December I8-I9, I926 pen- umbral lunar edipse and the January 3, I927 annual s0lar edipse

that was I8O° pri0r t0 the edipses 0f June I927? D0es it mean that if the edipse is n0t a t0tal event it is n0t meaningful? But Gann did n0t 0verl00k these dates as they are the c0mp0siti0n dates 0f letters written t0 Kennelw0rth within Gann’s st0ry.

The 0uter dial 0f a Gann Wheel (Square 0r Hexa90n Wheel) will place dates 0f June 22 0n the N0rth axis and December 22 0n the S0uth axis. A six-m0nth peri0d is a I8O° separati0n in calendar days.

These edipse dates that fall I8O° bef0re Gann’s June I927 references are needed t0 duplicate Gann’s Tunnel predicti0n f0r a market t0p in September I927. The cyde beat we sh0uld track is 0n the 9O° calendar day axis that starts fr0m each edipse. The I8O° transit beat in calendar days fr0m the Lunar Edipse 0n December I9,I927 falls 0n June I9, I927. The next 9O° transit falls 0n September 20,I927.

Tunnel 0n pages 62—63 rec0rds the letter t0 Mr. Kennelw0rth dated January 15, I927. This is twelve days after the S0lar Edipse 0f January 3, I927. The number twelve in Tunnel is always imp0rtant. These are c0tt0n price l0ws that Kennelw0rth states f0r us in Tunnel 0n page 94. “Mr. Kennelw0rth was als0 very happy and c0ngratulated R0bert 0n being able t0 buy c0tt0n very d0se t0 the l0w level in January.”

In the qu0ted passage that f0ll0ws, n0tice that Gann instructs Ken- nelw0rth t0 buy c0tt0n near April 5, again just after the 9O° target date. If we place the 0° axis 0f a Wheel’s dial 0n the January 3, I927, the S0lar Edipse date, we find the 9O° angle 0n the Wheel will be 0n April 2/3. (It will align in the middle 0f the tw0 dates.) Using either the Hexa90n 0r Square 0f Nine Wheel the 9O° cydes 0f imp0rtance fr0m January 3, I927 will fall 0n the dates April 2/3, I927, July 5, I927, and Oct0ber 5/6, I927.

Gann further instructs Kennelw0rth t0 buy Wheat and C0m 9O° after the S0lar Edipse date. This is very imp0rtant. Market trends will 0ften run t0wards the 9O° time fact0r fr0m near 0ne New M00n phase t0 the next, sec0nd, 0r third New M00n. The 9O° time fact0r falls near the third New M00n, causing the market reversals t0 un- dulate 0n the calendar-day beats 9O° fr0m the edipse dates.

Tunnel dem0nstrates Gann’s use 0f the calendar-day cyde 9O° fr0m an edipse in 0ther markets.

On this day he made a new and great disc0very 0fa time fact0r fr0m which he figured Maj0r M0t0rs w0uld dedine until ab0ut June 30th and then _ start an advance which w0uld last until ab0ut September I6th, I927, — when the C0mpany w0uld be I9 years 0ld at that time the st0ck w0uld reach a final high and w0uld then 90 d0wn t0 February/April I929. _ He figured that the st0ck sh0uld advance t0 ar0und 27O by September _ I6 and made up his mind t0 watch it d0sely and c0ver his sh0rts if _ it went d0wn ar0und June 30%, and then start buying the st0ck. On June 30" it dedined, and he b0ught in his sh0rt c0ntracts and b0ught f0r l0ng acc0unt SOO shares 0f Maj0r M0t0rs at I92I4. He decided t0 pyramid it all the way up... On August 8 8th his st0ck was s0ld 0ut (0n a st0p l0ss) at 22S. [Tunnel Thru The Air, p. I97]

We w0uld rec0rd the 9O° angles fr0m January 3, I927. They are

April 2/3, July 4, and Oct0ber 4/5. Set the 0° angle in the degree ring t0 align at the January 3 date. Then read in a c0unterd0ckwise di- recti0n t0 see where the 9O° angles fall in the calendar date ring. The 9O° angles fr0m December I8-I9, I927 are March I8, June I8, and Sept I9. The S0lar Edipse was June 29, I927 f0rming a c0nfluence time fact0r where a tight range 0f time cydes gather. A price l0w is rec0rded. When we place 0ur 0° angle 0n the Lunar edipse 0f June 15, the 9O° cyde beat falls 0n September I6, I927, giving Gann’s cal- culati0n f0r a price high.

There is a similar setup f0r the DJIA appr0aching in 20I9. De- cember 26, 20I8 is a natal Sun time fact0r.” The natal Sun 0pp0siti0n, c0njuncti0n, and square are imp0rtant fr0m the January 20I8 high. On January 5—6, 20I9 there will be a Partial S0lar Edipse. This l00ks t0 be a maj0r b0tt0m f0r Eur0pean and DJIA markets.

fav0r the edipse d0sest t0 the c0nfluence cyde near December 2S—27, 20I8. Fr0m my Elli0tt Wave interpretati0n, 1 feel that the 20I8 c0r- rective swings this year are defining wave (4) d0wn in several gl0bal indexes within their larger trends. The January 5—6, 20I9 edipse cyde, like the cyde in I927, sh0uld be a DJIA buying 0pp0rtunity. We can then map the 9O° cyde beats 90ing f0rward fr0m January 5, 20I9. They will fall 0n April 5, July 7, and then Oct0ber 8, 20I9. A DJIA ptice l0w near January 5, 20I9 c0uld pr0duce a price high near April 5, 20I9. 1 find pe0ple read this t0 mean a final high. N0. Just a price swing high that c0uld be br0ken later in the year. 1 very much like the April time fact0r f0r a price high because there are 0ther time fact0rs gr0uping near this date that the DJIA has respected in 20I8. We will see what happens and whether I927 and 20I9 have any similarities.

Tracking these three markets t0gether will have technical setups int0 the event that fav0r a c0rrelated 0utc0me. The lunar edipse at the t0p 0f b0th charts is an example.

A. FOUNDATION CONCEPTS

Gann used swing charts thr0ugh0ut his career. He did n0t create the c0ncept, but 1 d0 n0t kn0w the 0rigin. Swing charts have character- istics similar t0 p0int-and-figure charts. H0wever, there are several maj0r differences.

Scanning the Web sh0ws that pe0ple think that swing charting rem0ves all remnants 0f time as p0int-and-figure charts d0. But this is n0t true if y0u are creating a Gann swing chart. Time is n0t dis- played as a fixed linear scale 0n the x-axis. 1’ll explain in a m0ment.

Figure 2S.I4 is a simple swing chart fr0m weekly EURUSD data. There is a reversal setup, as in p0int-and-figure charts. In this chart a new swing is drawn when 2 bars, in this case 2 weeks, reverses the trend. F0r this reas0n, Gann called this his Trend Indicat0r.

Swing charts filter n0ise fr0m the price acti0n s0 a m0re 0bjective 0pini0n can be 0btained fr0m the chart ab0ut market trends. As l0ng as a market is making higher price highs, and higher l0ws, it remains in an uptrend. If the market makes l0wer price l0ws and l0wer price highs, it is in a bear market 0r at least a deeper c0rrecti0n. These charts are best used f0r l0nger h0riz0n trend analysis. It d0es n0t mean 0ne cann0t use them intraday, but pers0nally 1 d0n’t use swing charts f0r intraday purp0ses. Swing charts 0ften all0w me t0 see better-defined Elli0tt Wave structure. F0r this reas0n, as 1 like t0 still see intemal

Swing Charts

swings, 1 tend t0 set my reversal t0 2 bars. The higher the reversal peri0d the fewer swings will be present in y0ur swing chart.

Figure 2S.Ia 0ffers 0ne applicati0n. The appr0ach has been dis- cussed in 0ther chapters, and it reappears again. The black arr0w p0inting t0 the swing high at ‘A’ is the start 0f a str0ng dedining swing. As 1 teach in Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0nes, str0ng bars, 0r in this case a swing, are the milest0nes in a market that tells us the math grid the market is using t0 create future price acti0n. The advantage 0f using p0ints ‘A’ and ‘B’ is that the angle can be defined with0ut a third p0int. Classic technical analysis states that y0u need the third p0int t0 c0nfirm a trend. In Figure 2S.Ia the trendline uses ‘B’ because we kn0w the price high 0f a swing is the end 0f a campaign, and the sec0ndary retracement starts the new. 1 w0uld rather use the start 0f the new trend. With the angle 0f the trendline defined, we see the EURUSD wedged t0 its underside and failed.

Line ‘2’ is a direct c0py/paste trendline 0f the first. As the angle is kn0wn, we 0nly need select a starting swing l0w t0 pr0ject the trendline. In my 0wn chart 1 created a narr0w channel by creating a line fr0m the retracement just ab0ve ‘2.’ F0r darity it was rem0ved, as the market dearly used the angle fr0m ‘2’ at tw0 critical pullbacks bef0re the third time when it just melted right thr0ugh the trendline 0n the far right.

D0 y0u recall the rec0mmendati0n t0 use wave iii 0f 3’s t0 pr0ject

ge0metry, trendlines, angles, and m0re? This is an0ther example with the results t0 sh0w y0u why these p0ints 0f reference are rec- 0mmended. Trendline fr0m intemal swing p0int ‘3’ is a third wave and warrants a trendline angle fr0m the swing l0w. T0 the very far right, we see EURUSD has a swing high just 0ver the trendline (l00k just t0 the right 0f the hard Eur0 break); prices pull back slightly, push up int0 the underside 0f trendline ‘2; and then break d0wn. This is a current chart and EURUSD is currently using trendline ‘3’ as resistance, th0ugh the start 0f trendline ‘3’ is fr0m a third wave p0siti0n many years a90. Third wave swings always remain valid and imp0rtant.

M0st pe0ple using swing charts will tell y0u t0 use swings f0r st0p placement and t0 define entry levels where swing b0tt0ms are at levels where swing highs f0rmed. They are using swing charts like p0int-and-figure. A linear vertical series 0f ‘x-es’ 0r ‘0s’ can have a price target based 0n the h0riz0ntal width 0f the c0ngesti0n pattem 0n the h0riz0ntal axis pri0r t0 the break0ut m0ve. This meth0d d0es n0t apply in swing charts.

Hidden within each swing is a wealth 0f inf0rmati0n ab0ut the trend and ab0ut every swing, be it up 0r d0wn. If y0u 0nly use swing charts as drawn in Figure 2S.Ia, y0u will never be able t0 display all the in- f0rmati0n being c0llected f0r each swing. Figure 2S.Ib remains the EURUSD market, but t0 sh0w y0u the inf0rmati0n being c0llected 1 have sm00thed the chart further by using 2-week bars and retaining the 2-bar reversal. My swings theref0re need 2 peri0ds, 0r a m0nth 0f a trend reversal, bef0re a new reversal swing can be drawn. This all0ws me t0 create a chart that sh0ws y0u the underlying details. Ab0ve and bel0w each swing are five r0ws 0f details f0r that swing.

They are:

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

* the price high 0r l0w at the piv0t level,

* the number 0f bars within the swing; f0r example ‘Bs’ w0uld mean a durati0n 0f 5 2-week intervals,

* the number 0f calendar days within the swing, f0r example ‘C112’ f0r 112 calendar days,

* the date 0f the reversal,

* the Price Rati0, a c0mparis0n 0f price m0vement relative t0 the nearby pri0r swing,

* and the Time Rati0, the am0unt 0f time the swing’s trend de- vel0ped relative t0 the time 0f the pri0r swing.

Because we rec0rd the date 0f the reversal and the time rati0 gives a percent c0mparis0n t0 the previ0us swing, there is an element 0f time that p0int-and-figure charts cann0t rec0rd. Other details such as the arithmetic price range are c0llected, but pers0nally 1 fav0r using the bar c0unt and calendar day c0unt and n0t price range.

H0w d0 1 use these details? The first way is t0 scan the swings t0 find where price highs became price l0ws. These are areas 0f market supp0rt and resistance. Tw0 are marked f0r y0u with black arr0ws. The piv0t price level is always the first r0w 0f the c0lumn 0f details. Then 1 scan the dates. 1 am mentally d0ing a tally 0f the number 0f times a maj0r trend reversal 0ccurs in the same m0nth. In many markets y0u will find February and July are repeated. S0metimes the repeating swing reversals f0rm a pattem and can define f0r us a trine versus square market. If y0u d0 n0t kn0w the m0nth angles fr0m March 22, y0u can use the 0uter dial 0f a Gann Square 0f Nine Wheel until they are easily 0btained fr0m just a starting peri0d.

Then we mine further d0wn the c0lumns. Next is the Bar c0unt

f0ll0wed by the Calendar Day c0unt f0r the swing. Gann taught us t0 always be aware 0f the durati0n 0f the l0ngest bar in the pri0r trend. If the l0ngest c0unt f0r a swing in an uptrend is I9O calendar days, and y0ur new swing d0wn has exceeded it, the 0ld trend is dead. It d0es n0t mean that there cann0t be a deep retracement 0r even a punch thr0ugh t0 0ne new high, but f0r 0ur purp0ses and f0r market m0mentum purp0ses, the 0ld trend died at the t0p 0f the swing that began a new c0unt greater than the l0ngest durati0n 0f any swing in the pri0r trend.

Y0u will see wamings when the market advances 0r dedines the same distance but takes twice the am0unt 0f time t0 c0ver the same range. That’s a waming. L00k at diminishing ranges with time c0unt issues as y0u will find t0 the left 0f the big dr0p in the middle 0f the chart in Figure 2S.Ib. If y0u d0 n0t see ranges easily fr0m just the price highs and l0ws, add the range t0 y0ur c0lumn. But y0u will find that five r0ws are easy t0 read, but when y0u add a sixth 0r seventh, all the r0ws bec0me a blur and difficult t0 read. Y0u are l00king f0r relativity acr0ss the c0lumns in b0th price and time rati0s.

Figure 2S.Ib sh0ws swings marked ‘A’ up, ‘B’ d0wn, and ‘C’ up. These are very dean Elli0tt Wave swings with a series 0f swings that map the 3-3-5 pattem defining an expanded flat c0rrecti0n. The price f0r ‘C’ at the high is 1.2SS7. A swing l0w that devel0ped 0n the far left is at 1.2044. T0 my thinking, that is a wide spread. Theref0re, 1 always have a chart with my Gann and Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0nes t0 read precise levels 0f resistance and supp0rt. These swings are best f0r trend evaluati0n, s0 the best measures will be the bar and calendar c0unt, price rati0, and time rati0s.

What y0u want t0 read fr0m the chart will define h0w y0u wish t0 set it up.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

Figure 2S.2 is the St0xx Eur0pe 6OO fr0m 2-m0nth bars and a 1-bar reversal. It sh0ws that a Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne was calculated near the 335 price level. H0wever, the swing chart has a hist0ry in a range fr0m 326.47 t0 332.87. The swings that reacted t0 this price range are marked with black arr0ws, sh0wing the area 0f the chart that 1 will want t0 widen. As 1 write this in N0vember 20I8, this target area is a future price. The chart has five ephemeris t00ls applied t0 the swings. If there was n0 element 0f time, we c0uld n0t apply this t00l. But it is 0nly accurate at the very c0mers 0f the swing. Placement 0f the t00l within the width 0f the swing uses an estimated time peri0d within the swing c0mers. Theref0re, this t00l is just a quick guide, and the last 0ne, 0n the far right, sh0ws that aspects 0f great interest w0uld 0ccur 0n the pr0jected supp0rt. 1 w0uld take the time t0 set up these same aspects 0n a c0nventi0nal bar chart in a much sh0rter time h0riz0n f0r accuracy.

Gann used swing charts acr0ss many st0cks. Figure 2S.3 is created fr0m a 2-week bar chart f0r JP M0rgan (JPM). The swing setup uses a 2-bar reversal, 0r 4-week filter. F0r th0se wh0 like t0 use channels, 1 selected an upper trendline with an angle defined by c0nnecting tw0 swing highs. The first swing high f0rms the cr0ss with the angle m0ving d0wn fr0m t0p left t0 b0tt0m right. The t0p trendline m0ving b0tt0m left t0 t0p right was c0pied/pasted using the extreme swing l0w in the middle 0f the chart. All the 0ther swing l0ws that tested this l0wer channel line 0nly served t0 c0nfirm that this was the critical trendline. Figure 2S.3 als0 displays a Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne near the $8O price area when y0u scan 0ver t0 the y-axis. The vertical line 0n the far right marked 2/1/20OO will n0t match the date 0f the swing. This is why many pe0ple say that swing charts c0mpletely rem0ve time, like p0int-and-figure charts. But we saw in the last chart that

time is a c0llected measurement f0r each swing, s0 it is actually just a different c0ncept 0f pl0tting time which can be very useful.

Figure 2S.4 is a chart f0r Crude Oil Futures created fr0m 2-day bars. 1 have n0t created a filter f0r each swing, s0 it is set at a 1-bar reversal. The reas0n f0r this setup is that 1 wanted t0 set a 4S° line and apply a set 0f fan angles. The swings make it very dear that the 4S° angle was the maj0r trend up. When it was smashed, Oil fell t0 the intersecti0n 0f the 1 x 2 anda 1 x 3 cr0ssing angle pr0jected fr0m a different piv0t p0int. Swing charts have vari0us purp0ses in the hands 0f different pe0ple. Charts 2S.1 t0 2S.4 c0ver several ideas f0r y0u t0 c0nsider. Keep in mind that directi0nal signals will be seen and apply in swing charts as well. But swing charts have an0ther purp0se. They can be helpful in very big picture trend analysis.

Figure 2S.5 is the very l0ng, big picture f0r the DJIA using m0nthly data since January I9OO. B0th charts have a 2-bar reversal filter setting. The difference between these tw0 charts is that the left-hand swing chart is in arithmetic scale. The far-right chart is semi-l0g. It is the 0nly chart y0u will find in this b00k sh0wing semi-l0g. 1 am n0t a semi-l0g supp0rter as 1 have stated several times because harm0nics are in l0garithms and 1 d0 n0t want l0gs 0f l0gs. But the far-right chart is h0w s0me Elli0tt Wave practiti0ners see a deeper crash bel0w SOOO. The f0recasts 0f dramatic and deeper c0rrecti0ns fr0m semi-l0g charts have n0t been pr0ven c0rrect f0r several decades. It is w0rse when targets are exceeded and the chart is then c0nverted t0 a percent l0g chart. In my view it is just a dist0rti0n, and 1 have never seen this ma- nipulati0n 0f the data yield results. 1 think a big dedine is ahead, but we have n0t seen the highs fr0m which such a dr0p will 0riginate— that said, we are d0se.

The chart 0n the left remains in arithmetic scale. It suggests that

49S

the market is 0nly appr0aching the end a Wave (3). That isa slightly m0re p0sitive view, but it is dire all the same. The chart 0n the left sh0ws the n0rmal areas f0r a c0rrecti0n. First target I7,OOO w0uld be a minimum, especially since the recent c0rrecti0n tested 23,OOO fr0m higher levels. That pullback defined a f0urth wave within wave (3). At the time 0f this writing the f0urth wave was still devel0ping. If the entire advance fr0m the 64OO price area ends wave (3) up, the n0rmal pullback t0 a previ0us f0urth wave w0uld mean the DJIA w0uld fall t0ward 11,OOO—11,9OO. A gl0bal panic w0uld push the DJIA t0 S30O t0 64OO. 1 believe it w0uld then b0tt0m. H0w d0 y0u kn0w which is c0rrect?

Intermarket analysis is the answer. Y0u cann0t have such a dedine and n0t see it appr0ach and devel0p with a similar magnitude dr0p in Eur0pe, Asia, and Australia. That w0uld be true f0r a sustainable b0tt0m. Markets are s0 c0nnected n0w that we can never f0cus 0n just 0ne index d0se t0 h0me that is likely y0ur primary instrument t0 trade.

B. GLOBAL MARKET ANALYS15

Let us take a real-w0rld and real-time l00k at the gl0bal equity indexes as 0f N0vember 20I8. The place t0 start with is Australia. Why? In Chapter 2 when we first l00ked at gl0bal market relati0nships, we saw in Figure 2.2 that the Australia All Ordinaries was leading China’s Shanghai C0mp0site int0 the start 0f the big bull market rally. Since the time that chart was captured, Australia has been diverging these days t0 China’s dedine as sh0wn in Figure 2S.6. It is causing Australia t0 devel0p an Elli0tt Wave pattem called a terminati0n wedge. The name is, as it s0unds, a red flag waming.

2-m0nth chart. The first step is t0 see where the market is p0siti0ned relative t0 a simple 4S° angled trendline marked in the chart. 1 truncate the key reversal spike at the March 20O9 l0w. Why? Because 1 am far m0re interested t0 find that the ASX 20O br0ke this trendline in July 0f 2015 having successfully stayed ab0ve it with tw0 maj0r sets 0f railway tracks, 0r key reversals, first in May and July 0f 20I3, and then in September/ N0vember 0f 20I4. After the breakd0wn July 2015 the market failed every challenge t0 retum ab0ve this line. 1 read this as a waming that China’s cash fl0w int0 Australia is dedining. Aus- tralia, based 0n charts, is very dependent 0n the health and well-being 0f China’s ec0n0my. As we kn0w n0t t0 believe any ec0n0mic data fr0m China, this is a far better and m0re transparent read 0n what is really 0ccurring in China.

What 0ther market is heavily dependent 0n China’s ec0n0mic c0n- diti0n? India. We will l00k at that market in a m0ment. First, we want t0 view the ASX 20O as a l0ng-term swing chart because we are evaluating trend.

Figure 2S.7 is the Australian 5&P/ASX 20O as a 2-m0nth Gann swing chart with a 1-bar reversal. The first thing that may raise a questi0n is seeing the astr0l0gical events 0n a swing chart. H0w did 1 d0 this? 1 cheat the s0ftware by applying 0nly the Jupiter 68-degree planetary angle 0n my bar chart first, then 1 c0nvert that chart t0 a swing chart. Keep in mind that the best they can 0ffer in a swing chart is a r0ugh guesstimate 0f their c0rrect juxtap0siti0n within a swing. The ephemeris wheels in the chart can be added directly t0 the chart. The m0st accurate placement w0uld be 0n the left-hand c0mer. Everything else is an estimate within the width 0f the swing bar. S0 again, 1 use it as an indicati0n, but y0u cann0t deny that the swing int0 the present market t0p September 0f 20O7 is a rare cul-

minati0n 0f aspects. There is a Grand Trine and three 0pp0siti0ns, 0ne 0f which is defined by a price 0pp0siti0n t0 Mercury. The Grand Trine and 0pp0siti0n t0 price have my interest. 1 retum t0 the bar chart in Figure 2S.6 t0 expl0re where a duster 0f astr0l0gical events c0uld be f0rming in the future.

Figure 2S.6 displays a Heli0centric Jupiter 68° transit angle with repeats and a Natal Ge0centric Venus retum aspect fr0m March 4, 20O9 (near the l0w 0f the 20O8 meltd0wn). There is a tight duster 0f these tw0 astr0n0mical events int0 the March 20IO market high. Again, this duster t0pped the market in March 2015. 1 theref0re w0nder when these tw0 begin t0 culminate near 0ne an0ther int0 the future. The answer is marked with tw0 vertical lines 0n the chart marking a range fr0m mid-N0vember 20I9 t0 early February 2020.

The same chart als0 displays a Uranus Retr0grade cyde thr0ugh the chart. We see the recent t0p in August 0f 20I8 was the same m0nth as the Uranus Retr0grade m0ti0n. It d0es n0t add further weight t0 the aspects identified f0r the late 20I9 wind0w. F0r n0w, that wind0w 0f time is sufficient as it is a year away. We still must find a b0tt0m t0 the recent dedine and map the swing that w0uld f0ll0w t0ward th0se dates in sh0rter h0riz0n chart w0rk. Let’s stay with the big picture.

1 then add a trendline with a c0nfirmed angle 0f 315 degrees t0 determine a true dedining 4S-degree angle. 1 add a set 0f fan angles placing the 1 x 1 parallel t0 the 315-degree trendline. Y0u will see it starts 0ne bar t0 the right 0f the maj0r key reversal int0 the market t0p. Gann w0uld have used the price high. Y0u w0uld have seen that the bars d0 n0t respect the angles when drawn fr0m the high. But, and this is a big “but,” Gann w0uld als0 have created a channel fr0m the bar 1 selected. 1 just 90 directly 0ne bar t0 the right because:

2S. Less0n Five: Swing Charts

1. Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0nes have taught me t0 use str0ng bars and gaps. This is the start 0f the new d0wntrend.

2. The true start 0f the meltd0wn begins in the m0nth 0f the Jupiter transit angle, n0t at the t0p. This culminati0n d0es n0t happen 0ften and did n0t align with the price high. The planetary glyphs y0u see near the t0p are fr0m the ephemeris wheel placed 0n the bar t0 the right. They are n0t astr0n0mical events t0 the high.

3. The 315° trendline drawn fr0m this price bar catches the price l0w 0f the bar May 20I3 that intersects with the rising 4S° angle. Ge0metry is king in this decisi0n.

4. When 1 add the ephemeris wheel t0 the t0p 0f the January 20O8 bar, 1 see that price is 0pp0site Mars at I78.6 degrees, th0ugh waning. There is a Mercury c0njuncti0n Neptune and Venus c0njuncti0n Plut0 in the ephemeris wheel as well.

A set 0f fan angles are added t0 Figure 2S.6 0nly after 1 check that my price scale is still l0cked t0 SS, which 1 set pri0r t0 drawing the 315° dedining trendline angle. The fan angles are n0t impressive 0n the bar chart. The 0nly angle the market seems t0 be respecting is in the last bar where it failed at the underside 0f the 1 x 8. N0w 1 switch the chart t0 a swing chart.

Figure 2S.7 is the Australian 5&P/ASX 20O with the display setting c0nverted t0 a swing chart. It is a 2-m0nth chart with a 1-bar reversal. The aspect rati0 0f SS f0r the screen display setting remains l0cked and unchanged. The fan angles sh0w a strikingly different pr0file. They all map t0 swing l0ws except f0r the 1 x 4 which maps t0 a swing high. The dimensi0n 0f the swings will n0t let me add m0re than 0ne label ab0ve each swing as the labels are t00 l0ng. 1 decide t0 keep 0ne 0f my fav0rites that fits m0st swing charts, the calendar day

c0unt f0r the swing. The day c0unts f0r each swing 0ff the 20O9 l0w fits the pr0file 0f a market fighting every small gain. This is a rising terminati0n wedge which means, in Elli0tt Wave termin0l0gy, that it will crash rapidly t0 the 0rigin 0f the wedge at the l0ws in 20O9— h0wever, n0t just yet. H0w d0 we kn0w? This dedine is likely a f0urth wave pullback, and a weak fifth wave advance c0uld f0ll0w in 20I9. Why? Eur0pean and American equities are th0ught t0 be in f0urth wave c0rrecti0ns in 20I8. Theref0re, Australia has t0 stay c0nnected t0 a gl0bal reality. Y0u will never see this just l00king at a single market’s price data. In a bar chart, are the m0ving averages 0n the C0mp0site Index a p0sitive spread? An answer als0 lies with Bank st0cks, but first we need t0 c0ntinue with the gl0bal review. Chapter 1 gave s0me imp0rtant advice that applies n0w: Never take y0ur eyes 0ff banks. This h0lds true f0r any century.

Figure 2S.8 is the India BSE 30 m0nthly bar chart. The reas0n 1 0pen this chart first is because 1 kn0w that the BSE 30 has been tracking the Pytha90rean channels since they were set 0n the chart in 20O9. What d0 1 mean by Pytha90rean channels? Y0u will recall the less0ns 0f Chapter r0. In that chapter are the instructi0ns f0r creating a series 0f harm0nic intervals using the Pytha90rean Scale. Figures IO.I6 and IO.I7 will pr0vide y0u a reference p0int in this b00k. The channel intervals are the same pr0p0rti0ns as the Pytha90rean Diat0nic Scale visually defined in the insert 0f Figure IO.11. The intervals in units 0f cents were c0nverted t0 percentages: 20.4, 4O.8, 49.8... and s0 f0rth.

In Figure 2S.8 we see that the BSE 30 market t0pped int0 an inner channel. The key reversal t0p failed under the 49.8% harm0nic. 1 had already created the Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0nes 0f supp0rt 0n the h0riz0ntal axis because the third peak in the C0mp0site Index was the sec0nd divergence in the 0scillat0r.

indicat0r peaks in the chart.) The m0ving averages 0n the 0scillat0r were narr0wing when 1 created the supp0rt z0nes. These averages 0n the C0mp0site had n0t cr0ssed, but the Elli0tt Wave structure wamed 1 had t0 prepare supp0rt levels. What 1 see n0w is that the C0mp0site has br0ken bel0w the h0riz0ntal line drawn 0n it. The vertical dates sh0w three 0ccasi0ns when the 0scillat0r used this level as a buy signal in the c0ntinuing uptrend. N0w the 0scillat0r has failed t0 h0ld this h0riz0ntal level. The market has b0unced up fr0m a Fib0nacci c0n- fluence z0ne t0 the underside 0f the Pytha90rean channel intervals. We need t0 d0 a m0re detailed analysis. 1 keep this chart 0nly because the Pytha90rean channel has been active f0r s0 l0ng. But my dients prefer Nifty, s0 the charts that f0ll0w will display India’s Nifty Index.

It has been s0me time since 1 checked the intermarket relati0nships t0 India’s Nifty; theref0re 1 begin by viewing the current 0verlay c0mparis0n between the German Dax and India’s Nifty in a 3-week time interval. The last time we l00ked at this market c0mparis0n was in Chapter 2 in Figure 2.3. Much has devel0ped since that time. The German Dax was the dear diverging market t0 India’s Nifty at the recent highs. The German Dax gave much early waming by leading India’s dedine. What d0es that mean n0w? Our analysis task just grew significantly in size. We need t0 analyze and devel0p an 0pini0n 0f the German Dax because it leads Nifty. The 900d thing ab0ut tuming t0 the German Dax is kn0wing that the Dax leads the T0r0nt0 TSX st0ck index and the TSX leads the 5&Ps0O0. S0 in a very r0undab0ut way, it leads back t0 my h0me market, making it far m0re relevant t0 an American trader f0cused 0n 0ur indexes. Alright, we sh0uld 90 0ver t0 Germany’s market chart next. Grab a c0ffee; this c0uld take a while because the German Dax has c0mplicati0ns we have t0 address.

When we were l00king at aspect dusters in Chapter 23, 1 had

S93 captured the Dax weekly in Figure 23.I8. Figure 2S.IO updates that same chart f0r the German Dax in a weekly bar chart. At that time the market was resting 0n a 50% balance p0int in the Square 0f the Range. (H0w t0 draw the square is c0ming up in the next chapter). We can see that the Dax b0unced up in Figure 2S.IO and failed under the de- dining 4S° line c0nnecting c0mer-t0-c0mer 0f the square 0f the range. It means that the square has been drawn c0rrectly as the market has been respecting the pr0p0rti0ns within it. N0w the market is p0ised t0 break bel0w the 50% h0riz0ntal 0f the square. 1 am n0t w0rried that it may have just snuck thr0ugh the line, because 1 kn0w that at this same l0cati0n there is a maj0r Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne where the market is resting f0r the m0ment. Theref0re, it really has n0t br0ken thr0ugh just yet... butit will. What ab0ut Time Fact0rs? N0thing; bad sign. The aspects are like h0riz0ntal levels 0f supp0rt and resistance. In this case the next seri0us duster d0es n0t culminate until January 22, 20I9 t0 early February 20I9. Markets bec0me range-b0und when a wide band 0f astr0l0gical events gather. There’s n0thing here as far as aspects are c0ncemed. 1 have s0mething next week, but 1 cann0t use it just yet as we have n0t discussed squaring calendar days fr0m natal dates. That will be in the next chapter.

Wave structure is actually very dear. This market needs a f0urth wave c0rrecti0n and an0ther swing d0wn. The Gann purist w0uld state that a c0rrecti0n w0uld be trapped between the h0riz0ntal 50% and dedining 4S° angle within the square. W0uld that be 0ur 0pini0n t00? We will n0t answer the questi0n fr0m within the German Dax data.

1 menti0ned the German Dax c0uld be an issue. At this p0int we ba- sically kn0w that the dedine in the Dax is inc0mplete, and that w0uld mean the Nifty index is n0t at a b0tt0m either. But d0es the 0vers0ld

c0nditi0n c0rrect fr0m here? Is the Dax f0rming a d0uble b0tt0m at the 50% balance p0int 0f the square in Figure 2S.IO? It might be. But ‘might be’ is n0t 900d en0ugh. We must l00k at 0ther Eur0pean Indexes t0 darify 0ur view in the DAX. 1 wamed that this c0uld get m0re inv0lved. 1 knew this was c0ming.

Next, we will review the French CAC. Figure 2S.11 is the weekly French CAC Index. The channel lines 0n the dia90nal with d0ts are Pytha90rean intervals. Everything 1 wr0te ab0ut setting Fib0nacci channels will apply t0 the setup f0r these, but the intervals 0f the pr0- jected channels are the Pytha90rean Scale applied. The French CAC is 0n the dia90nal channel interval n0w. The h0riz0ntal levels are the Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0nes. 1 use them all the time; d0n’t think they are 90ing t0 90 away. 1 have a few students gr0aning because they wanted t0 skip this step and just d0 Gann. What we d0 need t0 ask when we see this dean arrangement 0f h0riz0ntal Fib0nacci c0n- fluence z0nes under the market is, “Which c0nfluence z0ne is the m0re imp0rtant 0ne?” This is the 0nly way 1 can answer this imp0rtant questi0n: use a Gann Wheel. N0rmally a Gann c0nfluence z0ne will 0nly match 0ne Fib0nacci z0ne. The tw0 meth0ds t0gether mark the line in the sand f0r the market.

The French CAC price data l00ks much deaner in an Elli0tt Wave structure perspective than d0es the Dax. Plus, these neat, tidy Fi- b0nacci c0nfluence z0nes tell me that this ge0metry is the market we want t0 view as a swing chart.

Figure 2S.I2 is the French CAC weekly displayed as a swing chart with a 1-bar reversal. The Elli0tt interpretati0n f0r a p0ssible ex- panded flat is what 1 was thinking bef0re 1 saw the swing chart. The swings marked A-B-C (w0rking ‘C’ d0wn) 0ffer a legal Expanded Flat pattem, but it has a pr0blem. Figure 2S.I2 0ffers a p00r interpre-

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

tati0n because the Expanded Flat pattem is way t00 big relative t0 a sec0nd wave that w0uld be within three narr0w swings. Pr0p0rti0n may kn0ck this idea 0ut the wind0w. Maybe we sh0uld c0nsider whether the French CAC is defining a zigzag dedine. Either way, 1 d0 n0t care, as it is dearly a f0urth wave pullback in the larger uptrend. That means that a swing d0wn t0 the Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne under the market at the first ‘C?’ and n0t the sec0nd ‘C?’ beneath will end the dedine. 1 tend t0 fav0r the l0wer target; h0wever, there is 0ne m0re imp0rtant step we sh0uld d0 bef0re we bec0me attached t0 this market 0pini0n. Step back. L00k at a l0nger time frame and view it in c0mparis0n t0 a sh0rter time h0riz0n t0 study intemal structure within the trend. The best rati0 t0 use is 4:1 where the rati0 is the l0nger h0riz0n t0 the sh0rter.

In Figure 2S.I3, the time h0riz0n in the French CAC weekly has been d0ubled t0 2-weeks in the left-hand chart. Otherwise it is the same chart as in Figure 2S.11. The right-hand chart is a 3-day chart. 1 have s0me h0riz0ntal levels marked with a black arr0w in the 3-day chart. There are tw0 sets 0f Gann Square 0f 9 pr0jecti0ns in the 3-day data. 1 kn0w we have n0t c0vered them just yet, but simply stated, the chart scale was fixed in the 3-day t0 6.7S. The Square 0f Nine must use the same price unit. The targets were pr0jected fr0m the high and the piv0t high 0f September 2I, 20I8—the day bef0re the fall equin0x and a Gann piv0t p0int. What we see fr0m the tw0 Gann Wheel pr0jecti0ns is the French CAC is 0n a maj0r Gann c0nfluence price target n0w. Elli0tt structure sh0uld jump 0ut at y0u: We are 0nly 0ne c0nfluence z0ne under a previ0us f0urth wave. L00k t0 the left t0 find ‘(4)’ where the market b0tt0med exactly 0ne Gann c0n- fluence z0ne higher than where it rests n0w. Elli0tt swings in f0urth wave p0siti0ns l0ve t0 gather t0gether.

They agree with 0ne an0ther. Had they been different this w0uld have created a c0nflict and is a way t0 detect c0mplex c0rrective pattems bef0re they even begin. In the left-hand chart, a black arr0w p0inting t0 the c0nfluence z0nes b0th under and 0ver the market sh0w that the l0wer c0nfluence z0ne is c0mprised 0f a 36O° and 4S° price 0bjective fr0m the Square 0f Nine as pr0jected fr0m tw0 different piv0t highs. Anytime y0u have a target z0ne that c0ntains 36O° it is imp0rtant. It will be hard t0 see in this chart 0ther than that the market failed 0n N0vember 6, 20I8 under the c0nfluence z0ne. But that z0ne marking the last piv0t high bef0re the current d0wn swing is c0mprised 0f a I8O° and 24O° target. When a market fails at I8O° and has a target near 36O° it is always significant. 1 ev0lved t0 pairing tw0 Gann Square 0f Nine pr0- jecti0ns fr0m price levels using str0ng bars and gaps and yes, reversal p0ints, based 0n my experience 0f creating Fib0nacci c0nfluence. The diehard Gann analyst just using Equal Temperament measurements might str0ngly disappr0ve. But this 0ne change dramatically increases the accuracy and understanding 0f h0w the market will react t0 the price target. F0r twenty years dients have seen multiple markets st0p and respect these levels. It has been pr0ven in public f0r a very l0ng time. When 1 c0ver the Wheel and Dials we will revisit this additi0n t0 Gann’s meth0d0l0gy.

An err0r is detected fr0m using the French CAC chart that was t00 narr0w atime span. It is a f0urth wave c0rrecti0n unf0lding n0w, but 0ne degree higher than 1 had first been thinking fr0m just a weekly

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

chart. Many analysts make this err0r and c0me t0 decisi0ns t00 fast. It is an expanded flat and the fav0red c0unt in an extending wave (C) dedine has been s0 labeled in the 3-day chart. 1 kn0w, it is risky t0 make a f0recast in a b00k that will be ar0und f0r a l0ng time, but the CAC will likely fall 0ne z0ne l0wer t0 c0me int0 sync with a few 0ther indexes. That means that when this dedine is c0mplete in Eur0pe and their indexes can attempt a rally t0ward the highs, s0 t00 will India.

As the Dax leads the India Nifty, we can then m0ve back t0 the Dax t0 reevaluate.

Figure 2S.I4 is the German Dax in a 2-day Swing Chart. 1 first tried a 2-bar reversal. This was n0t en0ugh t0 deanly display Elli0tt Wave structure. 1 increased the reversal t0 3-bars and liked what 1 saw. Itis a much easier chart f0r reading the trend. It 0ffers an excepti0nally dear wave pattem. Wave 5 0f (5) up is likely c0mpleted. F0r ease 0f labeling d0 n0t pay attenti0n t0 the degree 0f the waves. A single number simply sh0ws subdivisi0ns within the rally defined by wave (1) thr0ugh (5) ending a swing up, but it will n0t necessarily sh0w all the swings within a larger picture 0f the trend. This c0uld be a larger degree f0urth wave dedine n0w. N0 matter what wave inter- pretati0n is given, the current dedine is inc0mplete and will break that trendline running dia90nally thr0ugh the chart. If this was still undear and the p0siti0n 0f the German Dax remained a puzzle, what w0uld we d0? We w0uld build a bigger pr0file acr0ss 0ther Eur0pean indexes. 1 w0uld l00k at Britain, Spain, and Italy. The Swiss Market is imp0rtant as it is a mid-cap index. It theref0re can give a different pr0file. The Greece crisis is n0t 0ver. Their market t0pped in January 20I8 and has been 0n the dedine ever since. It wams it will hit the news again, but the real risk is Italy. We will c0me back t0 Italy in m0re detail within this chapter.

1 h0pe that y0u see 1 use swing charts t0 s0lve analysis pr0blems. There is always a pr0blem 0f s0me kind and having an arsenal 0f meth0ds y0u kn0w well will make the difference if y0u are t0 answer the questi0n 0f the day c0rrectly. It is n0t ab0ut leaming 0ne meth- 0d0l0gy and waiting f0r a single market 0f interest t0 arrive at y0ur perfect picture 0f a trigger p0int; it w0rks the 0ther way ar0und. Ask, What is the market trying t0 tell me? H0w can 1 c0nfirm this, using n0n-c0rrelated meth0ds? What 0ther market w0uld 1 see this in? If 1 cann0t see it, h0w d0 1 s0lve the pr0blem?

We began with a very l0ng-term view 0f the DJIA in America. A very significant ec0n0mic c0ntracti0n is n0t 90ing t0 be seen in 0nly 0ne market. It will be c0nfirmed by painting a similar picture in 0ther parts 0f the w0rld. We then m0ved t0 Australia’s 5&P/ASX 20O— we knew it leads China’s Shanghai. China’s cash fl0w int0 Australia is waning based 0n the chart w0rk we c0vered. We w0ndered if we c0uld c0nfirm this by l00king at India’s Nifty Index because it is an ec0n0my heavily dependent 0n China as well. Nifty can c0nfirm cash fl0w is waning in b0th Australia and India, and that reflects 0n China.

Figure 2S.15 is a m0nthly chart 0f the Australia 5&P/ASX 20O (dashed line), H0ng K0ng Hang Seng (heavy black line), and India’s Nifty Index (bars) in m0nthly 0verlays since August I99S. The vertical line near the middle 0n September 20, 20O7 sh0ws that Australia and H0ng K0ng t0pped bef0re India. The c0rrelati0n between these three markets is the reas0n 1 track them t0gether and discuss them n0w asa unit. H0ng K0ng t0pped well ahead 0f India in this chart. This sh0ws y0u h0w t0 find the markets y0u sh0uld put t0gether. But it als0 ex- plains why each market will have its 0wn astr0n0mical events. Y0u cann0t just c0py fr0m 0ne market and put it 0n an0ther. Each market

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

sh0uld be devel0ped separately, and 0nly then an 0pini0n ab0ut their interacti0n can be c0nsidered. As an example, we have a better idea n0w ab0ut India’s Nifty market because the lead market, the German Dax, has an inc0mplete dedine near-term.

In Figure 2S.I6 we see 0n the left India’s Nifty Index in a 2-m0nth Swing chart with a 1-bar reversal. On the right isa much sh0rter time interval in a 2-day bar chart 0f Nifty. The right side c0ntains a Gann Square 0f Nine series 0f h0riz0ntal targets. Again, 1 have started fr0m tw0 different piv0t highs t0 create Square 0f Nine c0nfluence z0nes. India is under 0ne 0f these z0nes n0w where a black arr0w p0ints t0 the high-risk level 0f resistance. It is high-risk because the C0mp0site Index is at the same displacement high (black arr0w) that aligns with the C0mp0site Index high just t0 the left and aligns with the price high marked ‘b’. Early chapters explained that m0mentum displacement in my C0mp0site Index f0rmula can paint a hist0ry with pr0bability. D0 n0t aband0n y0ur dassic technical analysis skills. This small example sh0ws y0u h0w 1 think and put analysis t0gether. It is never ab0ut the t00l; that is 0nly a res0urce f0r us t0 think thr0ugh the current situati0n. 1 cann0t stress this p0int m0re str0ngly. Let the market tell y0u what y0u need t0 d0 next. D0 n0t mem0rize a template 0f meth0ds and f0rce them 0nt0 a market, 0r y0u will never grasp the true art 0f technical analysis. Y0ur skill set must be s0 c0nfident and str0ng f0r y0u that y0u n0 l0nger think ab0ut h0w t0 d0 this 0r that. Y0u just kn0w y0u want an answer t0 ‘X’ and the best way t0 get there is by using meth0ds “Y’ and ‘2.’

z00m in 0n Italy’s markets. Figure 2S.I7 is the American Central Intelligence Agency’s map 0f gl0bal debt-t0-GDP rati0s in 20I7. Italy was sec0nd 0nly t0 Greece. (The USA is in the high 9O°s.)

Figure 2S.I8 is a c0mparis0n 0f three Eur0pean markets in 2-week data sets. When y0u make a study t0 guide y0u in 0ther markets, be sure t0 bring the market y0u just examined int0 the new set 0f data c0mparis0ns as a reference p0int. In Figure 2S.I8 1 display the German Dax, as that is a kn0wn fact0r, and then 1 0verlaid the Italian and L0nd0n indexes. As an aside, the British FTSE 100 Index has little t0 d0 with Britain when y0u examine the underlying c0mp0siti0n 0f that index. The better index t0 examine is the FTSE 35O as it indudes British c0mpanies within the index. The fast interpretati0n 0f Figure 2S.I8 is that we see the c0rrelati0n between the German Dax and the FTSE 35O, but the Italian Index cann0t get 0ut 0f its 0wn shad0w since the 20O8 c0llapse.

The Italian FTSE MIB is sh0wn in a 2-week swing chart with a 1-bar reversal in Figure 2S.I9. The first additi0n was t0 set the rati0 t0 29O. Why? 1 like the display 0f the range, n0thing m0re. 1 need t0 kn0w the rati0 t0 set my price units. First, 1 draw a 4S° and 315° trendline in the chart. The 4S° is used t0 create a channel f0r the advance in the right half 0f the chart. There is a narr0w channel where 1 drew tw0 315° trendlines fr0m tw0 swings near the high. Finally, 1 can add a set 0f fan angles. My usual placement is again dem0nstrated by selecting the swing just t0 the right 0f the high. The 3 x 1,2 x 1, 1 X 1, and 2 x 1 all map t0 swings within the chart. The placement fr0m the l0wer swing is c0nfirmed when 1 drag the t00l t0 the t0p and find the angles are n0t respected. It is m0ved back t0 the p0siti0n y0u see it in Figure 2S.I9.

S15

Then 1 start t0 expl0re three maj0r piv0ts with the ephemeris t00l. This is where it gets interesting. In May 20O7 the swing high displays Price at I3° Aries and Sun I6° Aries, a c0njuncti0n in 0rb. The swing l0w 0f March 20O3 sh0ws Sun c0njuncti0n Uranus, namely Sun 29° Aquarius t0 Uranus 28° Aquarius 49’, a very tight c0njuncti0n. We see the 0pp0siti0ns, but f0r n0w 1’ll m0ve 0n. The recent high within the swing near April I7, 20I8 sh0ws Sun 27° Aries c0njunct Uranus 28° Aries 28’. Yes, there is a Venus-Jupiter 0pp0siti0n, 0ne 0f Gann’s five fav0rites. But what catches my attenti0n is Italy’s reacti0ns t0 Sun c0njuncti0ns. We need t0 retum t0 a bar chart f0r m0re accurate timing.

Figure 2S.20 is the first time 1 have d0ne any analysis 0n the Italian market s0 the steps 0n h0w t0 first examine a data set are being de- scribed as 1 w0uld d0 them. My reacti0n t0 the chart in Figure 2S.20 is this: the Italian market has a l0ve affair with the Sun.

Figure 2S.2I is my next step. 1 c0nvert the swing chart int0 a bar chart as 1 need precise time display. The vertical lines thr0ugh the chart are the 0rb pr0perties, and 1 extend them thr0ugh the chart t0 see where the 0rb p0siti0ns align with price and t0 my C0mp0site Index. The c0njuncti0n is dearly being n0ticed by the Italian St0ck market. But as y0u kn0w 1 prefer dean chart displays and tum the 0rb vertical lines 0ff after this visual scan. What d0 we d0 next? Well, we kn0w 0ne astr0n0mical event is n0t the str0ngest Time Fact0r t0 lean 0n, s0 1 get t0 w0rk t0 find the cydes 1 w0uld use with this

market.

1 have added t0 Figure 2S.2I a Ge0centric Mercury I8° Transit with n0 repeats, in 0ther w0rds, I8° Aries retum f0r Mercury. D0es

this satisfy 0ur requirement t0 define a duster? L00k very d0sely at this chart and think ab0ut it.

2S. Less0n Five: Swing Charts

The dusters f0rming in Figure 2S.2I are nearly the same beat as 0ur first cyde. They are all dusters after the year 20OO. This cyde just means we’ve f0und a different way t0 visually see that the Sun c0njunct Mercury culminates near I8° Aries. This is interesting, but it is n0t a duster 0f different astr0n0mical events.

Figure 2S.22 has identified the aspect Heli0centric Mars c0njuncti0n Neptune. On 0nly three 0ccasi0ns in this chart did the Sun c0njunct Uranus cyde and the Heli0 Mars c0njunct Neptune cydes duster near 0ne an0ther. The first 0val is at the market t0p. The sec0nd time is at the market’s b0tt0m 0f the swing. This is h0w Gann w0uld call the durati0n 0f a large swing in the market. It is the repeat 0f the same astr0n0mical events. A third duster f0rms at a retracement where the market then falls t0ward the l0ws a sec0nd time. This cyde must stay 0n the chart even th0ugh there are n0 further duster gr0upings between the tw0. They will remain influential in their 0wn inde- pendent cyde beats within this market.

Figure 2S.23 c0ntinues with the Italian FTSE MIB 2-week chart. 1 have added a third event: Heli0centric Satum 2I° 7’ Transit. 1 am glad this cyde has appeared. Remember the Gann 0ffset? Y0u will have t0 90 back t0 that chapter. Satum 2I° 7’ is a 4 divisi0n in degrees. The minutes will be the same. 1 have highlighted key areas f0ll0wing the market t0p in 20O7. The first duster in an 0val that highlights a future date is April I2-28 0f 2020.

We have a 900d beginning f0r the Italian st0ck index, but a f0un- dati0n review cann0t just f0cus 0n astr0n0mical events. Figure 2S.24 is a study 0f price. The screen display rati0 is I74 as highlighted by an arr0w 0n the b0tt0m right. Tw0 sets 0f Gann Square 0f 9 price pr0jecti0ns are in this chart. One begins fr0m the March 20OO market high, the 0ther fr0m a sec0ndary swing bef0re the c0llapse in Oct0ber

§2I

20O7. B0th must have a price unit setting 0f I74. When it is t00 c0n- gested, y0u can multiply the price unit fact0r by 2, but b0th Square 0f Nine’s must be the same price unit. As we are here, and as we are nearly t00 c0ngested in Figure 2S.24, let’s see what that l00ks like.

The 0nly difference between Figure 2S.24 and 2S.2S is the price unit setting f0r the tw0 Square 0f Nine pr0jecti0ns. In 2S.24 1 used I74 0btained fr0m the l0cked aspect rati0 0n the b0tt0m right. In Figure 2S.2S this setting is d0ubled. I74 x 2 = 348. The spacing is less c0n- gested and remains respected by the market.

The Italian FTSE MIB is n0t 0n a b0tt0m. It will aim f0r the c0n- fluence z0ne under the market. 1 have placed an 0val ar0und the c0n- fluence z0ne because that z0ne c0ntains a I8O-degree target fr0m the 20O7 Square 0f Nine 0riginati0n p0int. The price range is I6,63 1— I7,O27. Fr0m there a b0unce is pr0jected, but it will n0t be a final l0w f0r this market as we kn0w the bigger picture.

We just leamed s0mething imp0rtant t0 the pri0r discussi0n. We kn0w the Dax, CAC, Nifty, and the Italian markets are n0t at a b0tt0m. What d0 y0u think this means f0r American st0ck indexes? Right, likely n0t 0n a final l0w in the current c0rrective dedine.

1 kn0w s0me will say that using tw0 Square 0f Nine pr0jecti0ns is n0t in Gann’s chart w0rk. Y0u might change y0ur view after y0u read the next chapter. Remember, a c0ncept 0n 0ne axis applies t0 the 0ther axes as well. Plus, Gann never had t0 deal with st0ck index ranges like what we see t0day. He als0 did n0t trade 0r analyze the gl0bal c0mplex 0f intertwined markets techn0l0gy has f0rced up0n us. If y0u want accuracy, use c0nfluence z0nes. As f0r the Oct0ber 20O7 starting level f0r a Square 0f Nine, please leam h0w t0 create Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0nes first. Then y0u will understand why such bars in the price acti0n are s0 imp0rtant.

Figure 2S.26 has made an imp0rtant change. The sec0nd set 0f Square 0f Nine price pr0jecti0ns has been m0ved s0 that the start is 0n the piv0t swing high 0f May 20O8. Why? This piv0t and the 20OO price high create a c0nfluence z0ne marked within the 0val where tw0 36O-degree targets defined the b0tt0m. Since we are still walking thr0ugh an initial setup, let’s keep 90ing.

The tw0 piv0ts in 20OO and May 0f 20O8 set the tw0 Square 0f Nine pr0jecti0ns int0 an interval sync, th0ugh fr0m different angles. This is a 900d thing as it will tighten up the target ranges 0f the c0nfluence z0nes as y0u will see m0mentarily. It als0 means that the tw0 piv0t bars we are n0w using have a harm0nic marriage t0 0ne an0ther.

After making the adjustment t0 the start 0f the sec0nd Square 0f Nine price targets, 1 w0ndered what was culminating int0 the price l0w that tested the same z0ne at the market b0tt0m the sec0nd time in July 20I2. The ephemeris t00l flashes a Grand Trine (still in the chart). 1 add the Uranus square Plut0 aspect. These 0uter planets will define 0nly an interval when they culminate in the chart as they are s0 sl0w-m0ving. But when they d0 have an influence they sh0uld be tracked until they fall 0ff the chart. The Uranus square Plut0 aspect w0uld be added fr0m near the market l0w and tracked until March 2015. These culminati0ns will be f0und in the large square within Figure 2S.26. It was n0t a t0pic we c0vered in the aspect chapter. Aspects d0 c0me and disappear fr0m the chart range, but they can be extremely useful when detected s00n after a significant reversal.

There is 0ne last thing t0 0ffer y0u in this chart—the swing pr0- jecti0n t0 determine a future target.

B0x ‘A’ is the range fr0m a c0nfluence z0ne, n0t the price high, t0a

l0wer c0nfluence z0ne. The l0wer b0undary is t0 the c0nfluence z0ne that defined resistance f0r a previ0us f0urth wave within the Elli0tt Wave structure 0f the dedine. The f0urth wave is the key here, being at a c0nfluence z0ne. Measure the range. N0w c0py the rectangle and swing the c0py d0wn fr0m the b0tt0m 0f ‘A, and ‘B’ lands nearly 0n a l0wer c0nfluence z0ne.

When 1 made an adjustment t0 the sec0nd Square 0f Nine, it narr0wed the price 0bjectives 0f the c0nfluence z0nes. The pre- vi0usly defined target at I6,63I—I7,O27 is n0w I6,8S6—I7,O27. With the market currently resting 0n the supp0rt diff with a v0id under it until this z0ne at I6,8S6—I7,O27 is realized, this is an extremely high pr0bability. The new target under rectangle ‘B’ is the c0nfluence z0ne at I3,4I9 t0 I3,S72. This target will be realized. Supp0rt ab0ve this target z0ne will be imp0rtant. Watch I4,S2I t0 I4,68O3 15,28O t0 15,443; and 0ur new tightened z0ne at I6,8S6—I7,O27. L0ng after this b00k c0mpletes pr0ducti0n y0u will have a way t0 see h0w we did t0day.

1 kn0w we still have the Square 0f Nine t0 c0ver, but using it f0r price is the easiest applicati0n, and when y0u are just starting t0 examine a market f0r the first time, y0u need s0me sense 0f scale f0r the swings that c0uld unf0ld. Plus, y0u have an0ther example t0 c0me back t0 in the b00k.

The questi0n sh0uld be if this is where 1 w0uld st0p n0w that 1 have a general 0pini0n 0f where this new market is heading? N0. 1 w0uld have a l0ng-term chart with astr0n0mical events, angles, and such, but 1 d0 n0t have the data bey0nd what 1 have sh0wn y0u. Next, 1 w0uld l00k at Italian Rates.

2S. Less0n Five: Swing Charts

Expanded Flat! The ‘A’ dedine and ‘B’ swing up is excepti0nally dear. It is even dear in a 2-week bar chart. The 0nly questi0n is where within wave ‘C’ d0wn are we currently? Only waves 1, 2, 3 are in place. A f0urth wave is in the w0rks 0r near, and then a fifth wave dedine lies ahead. Is that c0nsistent with 0ur picture f0r st0cks? Yes. An0ther push up in yields w0uld c0mplement further weakness in the FTSE MIB. The dedine in Italian B0nds w0uld fall within the range cirded as the previ0us f0urth wave. Elli0tt made it really easy. We are d0ne, as 1 d0 n0t see a c0nflict t0 the st0ck assessment. Y0u may n0tice that the use 0f Elli0tt is f0r the feel and is n0t a strict c0unt 0f every single swing. G0 t0 the bar chart if y0u d0 n0t see this wave in- terpretati0n. It is even dearer there. But 0ver the years 1 have leamed that the impulsi0n 0f the swing pr0p0rti0ns are just as imp0rtant as the intemals and rule-based c0ncepts. Get the pr0p0rti0ns right, and y0u will likely have the c0rrect wave interpretati0n as well. 1 kn0w ... it’s a Gann b00k, suck it up. Use all the t00ls available. It is always ab0ut integrati0n 0f meth0ds. If y0u knew n0thing ab0ut the Elli0tt Wave Principle, y0u’d have many, many m0re h0urs ahead t0 find an answer that was actually very simple.*

D. GERMAN FUNDAMENTAL DATA IN SWING CHARTS

Figure 2S.28 m0ves us int0 Fundamental data pl0tted as a swing chart. T0 transiti0n fr0m the last study 0f Italian markets, 1 am sh0wing the St. L0uis Reserve data “Jtaly—Jnterest Rates G0vemment Securities

* If y0u have a deeper need t0 track Italian B0nds, 90 t0: https://fred.stl0uisfed .0rg/series/IRLTLT0IrITQ156N. This site will plug y0u in directly t0 very l0ng h0riz0n yield data. FRED data fr0m the St. L0uis Federal Reserve can als0 be ac- cessed thr0ugh y0ur Optuma acc0unt if y0u subscribe.

S29 and G0vemment B0nds” since I9S8. The swing chart sh0ws a channel 0n 315° (4S°). There are tw0 sets 0f fan angles. The swing chart and just using the 4S° angles w0uld 0ffer value, but add fan angles as well, and y0u have an edge. Can fundamental data be displayed in such a manner? The first step is t0 examine which c0untry we want t0 spend 0ur time examining. Figure 2S.29 c0mpares German t0 Italian Yields fr0m I9S8 t0 20I8. With Italy’s Debt-t0-GDP rati0 being s0 high, it is a surprise t0 this n0n-ec0n0mist t0 find Germany’s rates f0rmed a d0uble t0p bef0re Italian Rates fell. German rates have been leading Italy’s at several juncti0ns. It makes me want t0 shift 0ur f0cus 0ver t0 Germany.

M0st 0f the German fundamental data 1 w0uld like t0 see has been disc0ntinued and replaced with 0ther data sets. S0 we have t0 bec0me m0re creative. As 1 am n0t a trained ec0n0mist, 1 can think thr0ugh the pr0blem by tapping int0 my experience as Brand Manager f0r Eastman K0dak’s C0l0r Pr0fessi0nal Films. The first thing 1’d like t0 kn0w is an indicati0n 0f Finished G00ds. Figure 2S.30 sh0ws de- dining st0ck levels 0f Finished G00ds in Germany. Figure 2S.30 is pure fundamental data, but there is a channel running thr0ugh the Finished G00ds data. What d0 new 0rders l00k like?

If manufacturing st0ck levels are 0n the dedine 1 w0uld want t0 kn0w if it is due t0 a reducti0n in pr0ducti0n 0r t0 an increase in 0rders. F0r n0w, it l00ks t0 be the latter if indeed this data is as it is named. If 1 were making a special rep0rt 1 w0uld have t0 ask s0me0ne t0 c0nfirm my data set the first time, but y0u have fallen int0 my web, ‘ye Fundamentalists.’ As l0ng as y0ur data set is n0t a straight line, y0u can use astr0n0mical events in a meaningful way 0n fundamental data. 1 kn0w. 1’ve heard the heated and passi0nate resp0nse bef0re: “Use fundamentals as fundamentals were intended.” Right.

Figure 26.1. Calendar Days

Squared.

Gann instructs us t0 maintain a c0unt fr0m the start 0f first trade date and maj0r events. Gann used 0ther time peri0ds t0 begin c0unts as well. He began fr0m maj0r price highs and l0ws. But hidden in Gann’s 0wn charts is a very smart f0recasting meth0d 1 have c0pied f0r starting fan angles. This is a very effective meth0d. Rec0gnize that calendar days and the number 0f bars are b0th valid c0unting units 0f time. Figure 26.1 is a magnified Gann chart. His charts have h0riz0ntal r0ws 0f hard-t0-read numbers that start 0n 0r very near the same h0riz0ntal level as a significant price piv0t. These are calendar day c0unts fr0m the piv0t date in days, weeks, 0r m0nths depending 0n the time h0riz0n and 0bjective 0f the chart. T0 un-

derstand Gann’s c0unting series the n0tati0ns d0 n0t have t0 be right beside the price reversal, 0nly 0n the same h0riz0ntal level as the price piv0t.

1 have magnified the middle secti0n 0f Figure 26.1. The l0wer level has an 0val t0 highlight Gann’s writing: “49 m= 7.” The square 0f 7 is 49. This sequence 0riginates fr0m the price l0w directly bel0w A 0n the b0tt0m left. He is c0unting the days and simply making n0te when a squared number 0ccurs. Directly bel0w the black rectangle in a sec0nd r0w, is a white rectangle 0n the r0w with the black 0val, where Gann writes “64 m= 8” f0ll0wed by “8I m 9” 0n the same h0r- iz0ntal level farther right. It is just a simple c0unt t0 mark when the

---

26. Less0n Six: Squaring Price and Time

square 0f each incremental number 0ccurs in the calendar day c0unt fr0m piv0t ‘A.’

The higher r0w sh0ws a rectangle t0 highlight were Gann wr0te “49 m7” again. The upper r0w is c0unting calendar days fr0m the price l0w at piv0t B. The giveaway is the fact that the spread between A and B is the same as the tw0 n0tati0ns “49 = 7” highlighted in the black 0val and rectangle. Ge0metry c0nfirmed that the c0ncept was c0rrect bef0re 1 started d0uble checking the actual c0unt fr0m each piv0t. If the price sh0uld arrive at a drawn angle 0n 0ne 0f these square value days, price is squared time at the angle 0f resistance 0r supp0rt.

It is very hard t0 see these marks in the actual chart, but y0u might be able t0 pick 0ut the writing under the piv0t bel0w p0int A. It says, “Buy % p0int.” T0 the NW c0mer ab0ve B Gann refers t0 an angle cr0ssing d0wn fr0m a p0int 0f 0rigin far 0ff the left-hand side 0f the page. Price did n0t t0uch the angle. It 0nly came d0se. Gann writes, ‘Sell angle.’ G0t y0u, Mr. Wiley C0y0te! N0w we see what y0u are d0ing here. Angle plus calendar day c0unt 0n a square value means acti0n. He is right, it w0rks.

Why did Gann sell? F0ll0w y0ur eye d0wn a vertical line fr0m the price high at 264 t0 the h0riz0ntal level near A. T0 the right Gann writes ‘9 m 3.’ If y0u cann0t l0cate Gann’s n0te, l00k tw0 half chart squares t0 the right 0f A. It is tiny, and that is why 1 magnified these segments. Everything 0f value is tiny 0r writing 0ver writing. We just f0und the first encrypti0n key t0 using the angles as a t00l t0 f0recast. The price l0w under B, where the market makes a key reversal, is a reb0und 0ff a Gann angle that 0riginated fr0m the price l0w under A. Under this sec0nd swing d0wn Gann writes, ‘Buy.’ Why? It is the square 0f 4, n0t visible fr0m a scanned image, but dearly 0n the ascending Gann angle.

This is n0t his 0nly use 0f square calendar day intervals 0n angles pr0jected fr0m price l0ws 0r highs.

1 d0 n0t think any0ne has 0penly put in writing this next applicati0n, induding Gann. Pay attenti0n as it is very effective. Gann created channel angles 0f his 1 x 1 0r 4S° fr0m the square dates. It will l00k as th0ugh the 4S° angle 0riginates fr0m a p0int in blank space within the chart. But it will always be 0n the h0riz0ntal level 0f the maj0r piv0t and vertically aligned t0 the calendar day marking a square.

We have l00ked at using Eudid ge0metry as 0ne way t0 create ge0metric dia90nal angles 0f supp0rt and resistance. We have als0 applied Fib0nacci rati0s t0 pr0ject additi0nal angles f0r use 0n the dia90nal fr0m a defined channel. Figures 26.2a thr0ugh 26.2c sh0w us h0w Gann creates dia90nal channels fr0m a date that is time squared.

Figure 26.2a is an enlargement within the same Gann December C0tt0n m0nthly chart fr0m I938 t0 I94S seen in Figure 26.2b. There are three r0ws 0f numbers 0n the b0tt0m sh0wing the c0unt in m0nths fr0m key price l0ws. Only in the t0p r0w 0f c0unting can we see the price l0w in the chart where the c0unt began. The tw0 r0ws fr0m the b0tt0m at a c0unt 0f ‘7O’ 0n the b0tt0m far-left, and ‘64’ in the middle r0w far-left are pr0gressing fr0m piv0ts 0ut 0f view. In 0rder f0r y0u t0 see the angles 0f greatest interest, 1 have had t0 draw three black lines directly 0ver the 0riginal lines Gann drew. H0wever, their integrity is preserved in the 0riginal chart f0und in Figure 26.2b. Ab0ve the far right 0r third angle in Figure 26.2a we see that Gann wr0te, “Dec I938.” The angle is the 4S-degree 1 X 1. It is drawn fr0m the square in time, starting 0n the same h0riz0ntal level as the December l0w 0f I938. Very, very, inter- esting, as n0where in his writings did Gann discuss this as far as 1 am aware.

The middle angles with a black lines are drawn fr0m the square 0f time, and fr0m the h0riz0ntal level 0f the price piv0t al0ng the b0tt0m r0w.

The first 0r far-left angle is drawn fr0m the start 0f the rally. An interesting thing happens when y0u use these dates t0 draw a series 0f 1 x 1 angles; they will have a harm0nic pr0p0rti0nal relati0nship 0n the dia90nal. It is really quite brilliant.

Figure 26.2c sh0uld make m0re sense f0r y0u n0w. We can see the price l0w 0n the far left in the chart. The fan angles being drawn fr0m this same h0riz0ntal level begin 0n the date square values. Y0u 0nly need the 1 x 1 andi x 2, 0r 2 x 1. Y0u can use the same h0riz0ntal level fr0m a maj0r high and then vertical alignment 0n a date square value t0 begin a d0wnward angle pr0jecti0n.

N0w we need t0 apply the use 0f squares that fall within the time c0unt after a piv0t.

Figure 26.3 is a daily bar chart f0r the 5&PSOO Cash Index. Early this year in 20I8 we had tw0 maj0r l0ws. Fr0m the first spike d0wn int0 February 2, Gann w0uld have c0unted calendar days. Mark the chart 0n days +49, +64, +8I with the labels ‘Sq 7} ‘Sq 8) ‘Sq g’and c0ntinue 0ut t0 the vertical line at the ‘Sq 0f 15’ and bey0nd t0 the Square 0f I9. Y0u will see the market t0p with the square 0f 11.

All the square n0tati0ns fr0m the square 0f 7 (49 calendar days) t0 the square 0f 15 (22S Calendar Days) 0riginate fr0m c0unting fr0m the February 2 l0w. But we have an0ther maj0r price l0w 0n April 2. Stay 0n the same h0riz0ntal level as the April 2 price l0w and start c0unting. The square 0f I2, day I44, falls near the square 0f I4 fr0m the earlier piv0t. Figure 26.3 and August 24 marks an imp0rtant cyde. H0wever, d0 n0t assume a “Big day” is a reversal. These target dates

S4I

can mark the resumpti0n 0f the larger trend after a l0ng peri0d 0f c0ns0lidati0n. This is very imp0rtant.

1 write a daily rep0rt f0r dients and trade. The rep0rt 0f August 26, 20I8 0ffered the f0ll0wing f0r the next trading week:

T0r0nt0 TD Bank c0ntinues t0 lead the indexes versus the T0r0nt0 St0ck Exchange. The T0r0nt0 TSE we kn0w leads the 5&PysOO. We are already 30 handles up since the August 23rd l0ws in the ESUI8. The c0nfluence Gann squares 0f I2 and I4 that fell 0n Aug 24 discussed tw0 weeks a90 is tracking f0r us t0wards the Oct0ber 26th target f0r a t0p. There are several technical reas0ns the DJIA, Nasdaq and 5&P SOO are p0siti0ned t0 experience a bl0w0ut m0ve upwards 0n news. Will there be a trade agreement ann0unced in the week ahead? NAFTA? China? Maybe just because there is little resistance present until Oct0ber.

What happened? President Trump ann0unced 0n Tuesday m0ming, August 28, a trade agreement had been struck between Mexic0 and the United States. The 5&PSOO ESUI8 futures c0ntract ran fr0m 28S4 t0 29I7 0n August 29. This is als0 the seas0nal trend. The tw0 Gann squares 0f I2 and I4 pr0jected fr0m maj0r l0ws marked the start 0f a third wave rally after a l0ng peri0d 0f c0ns0lidati0n that 0thers w0uld view as a distributi0n t0p.

1 did n0t have the c0rrect c0untry pairing 0f wh0 w0uld make a trade agreement, but the setup pr0ved c0rrect and the market 0utc0me was a nice trade. The fact that the setup technically was bullish sh0uld n0t be a surprise. D0 n0t assume a “l0w” will then be f0ll0wed by a target “high” using this meth0d. It is an inflecti0n p0int t0 be used with all y0ur meth0ds. 1 h0pe this example sh0ws y0u that Gann sh0uld be c0upled with c0nventi0nal technical analysis and inter- market analysis t0 impr0ve the pr0bability 0f y0ur strategy.

st0p placement fr0m August 23rd’s entry was less than f0ur 5&PSOO handles away fr0m the entry level.

One 0f the reas0ns 1 th0ught an agreement between China and America might be c0ming is that the Shanghai chart was p0ised f0ra c0rrective swing up. The marriage 0f the tw0 charts c0mplemented 0ne an0ther f0r a news release. 1 never l00ked at the charts f0r Mexic0. Perhaps this was a less0n t0 m0nit0r all parties when maj0r trade agreements have been br0ken and are being revised in unsteady markets. Often technicals in charts will lead a news event... n0t the 0ther way ar0und.

B. GANN TABLES

Gann used several tables. Y0u will find them described in the C0m- m0dity C0urses and in the St0ck C0urse in the “Master Charts” Less0n. 1 have versi0ns pr0duced fr0m the 78 Wall Street address, the 88 Wall Street address, 9I Wall Street address, and Brad C0wen’s edited versi0n. 1 will be referencing the earliest versi0n with the 78 Wall Street address. Gann had vari0us tables; we discussed the m0st well-kn0wn in Chapter 20 in Figure 20.I6. The table began in the first year fr0m the inc0rp0rati0n date 0f the NYSE with increments 0f 0ne f0r the first 20 years t0 I811. Then Gann w0uld r0ll t0 the b0tt0m 0f the sec0nd c0lumn 0n I8I3 and c0ntinue the c0unt t0 the t0p at I832. Each c0lumn w0uld c0ntinue the pattem. The c0ncept is used in vari0us ways. The same pattem is seen in Figure 26.4 f0r the Square 0f I2. The dia90nal lines f0rm a grid that can be used f0r calendar, week, 0r m0nth c0unts 0f time. Gann called the square 0f I2 by I2 the “Master ‘I2’ Chart.” It will always have I44 in the t0p right c0mer. But this chart can be applied t0 everything, meaning

Figure 26.5. Gann’s weekly Time Peri0ds Table.

We saw an0ther kind 0f table in Figure 20.6 where we mapped a S6-year cyde in c0lumns and a 20-year cyde in r0ws that seemed t0 match panics and recessi0ns when a dia90nal grid was drawn.

Gann’s Weekly Time Peri0ds table is very faint and hard t0 read; Figure 26.5 is an Excel spreadsheet t0 repr0duce the 0riginal s0 we can all read it. Using a Gann Wheel, July 23 and N0vember 22 fall 0n the I20° and 24O° 0uter ring when the start is set at March 20.

The 0ther dates are divisi0ns 0f eighths—a c0mm0n theme in much 0f what Gann d0es.

B0x ‘C11’ was legible in the 0riginal and gave the all-imp0rtant S2 number. Okay, 90t it. There are S2 weeks in a year, hence the table name. If we divide S2 weeks by eight it defines the fact0r 0f 6.5 in cell C2. C0lumn C marks the divisi0ns 6.5, I3, I7, I9.5, etc. Gann is c0unting S2 t0 gr0w the series al0ng each r0w fr0m the eights and

---

thirds date divisi0ns in C0lumn B. Draw Gann’s dia90nal grid 0n the Excel spreadsheet and we are ready t0 see h0w t0 use it and whether it w0rks.

Figure 26.6a sh0ws that March 2I, 20O9 was near the maj0r b0tt0m 0n the far left. Then 1 created a S2-week repeating cyde. N0thing here t0 get excited ab0ut. N0t impressed.

Figure 26.6b begins 0n Gann’s May Sth date fr0m his table in 26.Sb. N0w that shakes my c0re belief that fixed cydes are a waste 0f time. The S2-week cyde 1 marked at the respective price bars sh0w several interesting piv0ts. N0tice the S2-week cyde d0es n0t altemate between high-l0w-high-l0w 0r l0w-high-l0w-high. D0n’t make that assumpti0n.

N0w we want t0 test Gann’s dia90nal grid in Figure 26.Sb. The dia90nals in the table tell us that s0me intervals are m0re imp0rtant than 0thers. Let’s test it.

Figure 26.6c is still the DJIA weekly chart. 1 start Gann’s cyde fr0m his N0vember 22 date. 1 picked that date in 20O8 because it falls behind the maj0r piv0t, rather than being late and after the maj0r piv0t.

The N0vember 22 date in Figure 26.6c sh0ws where the dia90nal cyde fr0m Figure 26.Sb cr0sses 0n the f0urth and seventh S2-week in- tervals. Pr0ject the week c0unt. 1 drew a vertical line 0n the f0urth and seventh S2-week interval. That l00ks interesting as it is n0t s0mething t0 which 1 w0uld have given any weight 0r c0nsiderati0n. The cyde start is n0t exactly a mem0rable piv0t. Gann is telling us that it is ab0ut the interval that c0incides with a square fr0m his master dia90nal table. N0w that gets my attenti0n.

One 0f the pr0blems 1 have always had with Gann’s analysis is that he never analyzed 0verseas markets. If the meth0ds h0ld up, they sh0uld w0rk 0n b0th sides 0f the Atlantic. Figure 26.6d is the

34S

German Dax with a S2-week cyde started March 2I, 20O9. Whenever a S2-week cyde is being used by Gann, 1 kn0w there is a Sun aspect being applied in his w0rk in s0me way. We need 0nly find it. Figure 26.6d has a Ge0centric Natal Sun /Mercury c0njuncti0n and 0pp0- siti0n cyde displayed. Natal in mundane charting just means that rather than finding the aspects between tw0 planets starting fr0m Aries°, y0u just pick the starting p0int, in this case March 2I, 20O9. What is that in astr0l0gical degrees? Caught y0u. March 2I is 29° Pisces 4S’. This is the cusp 0f Aries 0° because we are 0n the spring equin0x that begins the new year. S0 natal 0r transit results will be the same fr0m this date. If 1 wanted the cyde t0 begin 0n a different 1/8th interval, then 1 w0uld use natal dates f0r the altemate 1/8th subdivisi0n.

Figure 26.6d sh0ws us the Ge0centric Sun c0njuncti0n Mercury culminati0n is very d0se t0 Gann’s S2-week cyde, but it is n0t a fixed cyde. The additi0n 0f the 0pp0siti0n aspects impr0ves the value 0f the chart. This is likely why 1 d0 n0t use Gann’s tables, but 1 d0 use the cydes displayed in 0ther ways. It als0 means 1 0nly need the aspect n0tati0ns 0n my chart which gives a deaner appearance. D0 n0t feel trapped int0 thinking that there is 0nly 0ne way and that we have t0 be tied t0 the same limitati0ns Gann had with0ut a c0mputer.

L00k d0sely at Figure 26.7, Gann’s Permanent Master I2 Table f0r Wheat. The chart is the Square 0f I2, but the ge0metric lines 0n the dia90nal create an inner square mirr0r 0r Hermetic Map. This is imp0rtant. Appendix C, Figure C.1 sh0uld be examined d0sely t0 leam h0w t0 read angles within a Hermetic Map. 1 have n0t seen any0ne reference this c0nfigurati0n 0f Gann’s Master I2 Table as a Hermetic Map.

in Figure 26.7, but he d0es n0t give a 900d descripti0n 0f h0w it is used. The missing puzzle piece is the kn0wledge 0f Hermetic Mapping.

Figure 26.7 c0nverts price int0 the I2 x I2 grid which is read as an angular c0nfigurati0n. Same number sequence t0 c0unt squares as Figure 26.5, but Gann starts in I842 because 0f the n0tati0n that the start 0f trading was in I84I. The years are added t0 each b0x and his table ends in I98S. It’s easy f0r a Wheat trader t0 extend the table. Just start the next c0lumn at ‘1’ again, jump d0wn t0 the b0tt0m t0 start I986 and w0rk up t0 I997 and repeat. Use it similarly as the DJIA discussi0n.

Figure 26.8 is Gann’s Financial Time Table. This is dearly a re- search table and the far-right c0lumn n0tati0ns are where 1 90t the idea t0 c0mpile a hist0rical reference f0r the Permanent NYSE Table dates in this manner (Figure 20.I6).

Bef0re we m0ve 0n please l00k at Figure 26.9. This table is a I2 by I2 multiplicati0n table. Ever w0nder why Gann starts cell Arg at I2 and n0t zer0? 1 did. If he started AIr4 at zer0, the 4S° line w0uld run fr0m t0p left t0 b0tt0m right. Seems like a 900d reas0n t0 reverse c0lumn A. Recall the discussi0n 0f Gann Fan angles that always pr0ject upwards within the NE quadrant 0f a cirde. This is the same idea being applied. The NYSE Permanent and Wheat Charts start at the b0tt0m left c0mer repeating the same pattem. Every number in this table pr0duces the result 0f multiplying a r0w by a c0lumn number. But there are s0me squirrelly things in this table. N0tice r0w six with number ‘8.’ Add 0ne t0 the number in a gr0wth cyde. D0 n0t add 0ne t0 cells D6, (E6—d0 add 1), F6, G6, (H6—d0 add 1) I6, J6, K6. We w0uld add 1 t0 cell L6 and s0 0n. N0tice the number 0f cells y0u skip will increase by 0ne.

26. Less0n Six: Squaring Price and Time

C. SQUARING PRICE AND TIME—SQUARING THE RANGE

One 0f the things 1 leamed ab0ut readers 0f my b00ks is that y0u l0ve real-time examples that sh0w the thinking and meth0ds applied as the markets are running.

Figure 26.IOa is the EURUSD m0nthly chart. The Eur0 dedine against the U.5. d0llar is sitting right 0n a I20-degree dashed line in the series pr0jected fr0m near the l0ws. My Fib0nacci students will kn0w that the start sh0uld truncate key reversals and left0ver tails in a trend. D0 n0t use Gann’s price extreme f0r the sake 0f using a l0w. The I20-degree level is interesting because the Eur0 t0pped in 20I8 at the 24O-degree resistance line in this chart. The t0p is a c0nfluence 0f astr0n0mical events that indude a defined Jupiter angle, Satum Retr0grade, and Ge0centric Mars I9° separati0n t0 Satum. N0w the Eur0 breakd0wn is 0n the I20° line. The Elli0tt Wave Principle tells me that this dedine is n0t 0ver. The t0p at the 24O° dashed line is likely the end 0f an Expanded Flat c0rrective pattem up in a f0urth wave p0siti0n. But in the first wave d0wn, within wave (5) d0wn, 1 am missing 0ne bar t0 the d0wnside. Where is wave 1 0f (5) 90ing t0 90? T0 the 9O° square 0f nine level at 1.I2SO. While n0t 0n this chart, y0u will see sh0rtly that 1 have an astr0n0mical reas0n f0r saying that this is n0t the l0w, either. 1 wam dients t0 expect 0ne wash-n-rinse cyde which we can then use t0 c0ver 0ur sh0rt Eur0s partially 0r buy a sh0rt-term trade f0r a c0rrective b0unce up.

In Figure 26.IOb, the EURUSD devel0ped the fast market d0wn, and s0 far the b0unce up is back t0 the apex 0f a small c0n- tracting triangle in prices. A black arr0w p0ints t0 the price d0se in this chart. An 0verlay ephemeris is applied where the center is 0n

SS3

the price high 0f this newest bar. Fr0m that p0siti0n we see that a Grand Trine aspect has f0rmed. The far-left c0mer 0f the triangle is price mapped t0 a l0ngitude angle. The mathematics 0f h0w t0 c0nvert price t0 l0ngitude will be c0vered in Chapter 27. Satum is trine t0 the EURUSD price, Venus is 0pp0site t0 price, and Venus is square t0 Satum creating the Grand Trine. An angular price rela- ti0nship t0 specific planets is 0ne 0f Gann’s effective meth0ds. It is imp0rtant. We need t0 set the stage in 0ur chart t0 see what devel0ps. In Figure 26.11, the rally fr0m the 20I7 l0ws int0 the 20I8 high is displayed in a weekly chart. This is the ideal setup f0r using Gann’s meth0d t0 Square the Range. We dr0p d0wn in time in- terval t0 a weekly view, s0 we can see the details. But 0nce this chart is set, y0u may n0t t0uch it. 1 have students that c0nstantly think they can use 0ne chart t0 d0 all things. This is n0t 90ing t0 w0rk f0r y0u.

Figure 26.11 sh0ws the 0ther reas0n why a swing d0wn was ex- pected besides the fact that there was a missing leg d0wn in an Elli0tt wave pattem; the market in Figure 26.IOa was n0t 0n the Time Fact0r. There was a time event at the I20° Square 0f 9 supp0rt level, the Sun c0njuncti0n Mercury aspect, but 1 knew it was n0t the c0rrect time cyde. H0w? Gann knew the trend durati0n by l00king f0r the setup that 0ccurred at the start 0f the swing; he knew that a repeating mirr0r culminati0n w0uld mark the end 0f the trend as it began. In this chart is a Heli0centric Jupiter I3° 7’ transit cyde. The cyde beat marks the t0p 0f the swing and the b0tt0m 0f the swing. H0wever, it is n0t ab0ut the individual astr0l0gical event al0ne. The retum 0f the duster 0f events repeats f0r the first time int0 the Eur0 l0w. At the t0p is Jupiter 0n the Heli0 angle 222° S9’. On the b0tt0m Jupiter is at 236° 6’ marking the I3° 7’ repeating transit 0n a Gann angle. (Why

26. Less0n Six: Squaring Price and Time

Jupiter I3° 7’ transit? There is a Law 0f Vibrati0n rhythm running thr0ugh the EURUSD. Use Heli0 I3° 7’ Jupiter angle transit with repeats, Heli0 33° 7’ Mars with n0 repeat, and Heli0 33° 7’ Venus with n0 repeat.)

Gann had three ways t0 square Price and Time. These are described in Gann’s F0urth St0ck C0urse, The Basis 0f My F0recasting Meth0d. The versi0n 1 am referencing has the 82 Wall Street address. 1 d0 n0t have page numbers.

There is a wh0le industry that has bl0ss0med in India, selling large

dasses based 0n Intemet p0stings, that has it wr0ng. “Price = Time?” ts n0t the same as defining a square with dimensi0n 0f Price by Time f0r height and width. This will be used when we discuss the Square 0f Nine. One is a wheel calculati0n, the 0ther is a ge0metric b0x— different meth0ds with different c0mputati0n results intended t0 be used in different ways. St0p teaching “Price = Time?” as a f0rmula t0 Square the Range. It has mushr00med int0 a virus.

There is an0ther maj0r industry misunderstanding. There are three ways t0 square “Time and Price,” as Gann writes in The Basis 0f My F0recasting Meth0d. First, Gann gives an intr0ducti0n t0 the secti0n “Squaring the Price Range with Time” and then 0n the 0pp0site page he presents the secti0n “Three Ways t0 Square Time and Price.” This has caused big issues f0r pe0ple because Gann c0ntradicts himself causing a misdirecti0n.

We are 90ing t0 use the f0ll0wing written instructi0ns. In “Three Ways t0 Square Time and Price,” Gann writes:

1—The range that a st0ck makes between extreme high and extreme l0w can be squared s0 l0ng as it remains in the same price range. If the range is 2S p0ints, it squares with 2S peri0ds 0f Time—days, weeks 0r m0nths. C0ntinue t0 use this time peri0d as l0ng as it stays in the same range.

SS7

In 0ther w0rds, there sh0uld n0t be a m0nit0r filled with endless repeating squares when applying this first meth0d 0f using a price range. But 0n the previ0us page, in his intr0ducti0n, he has just talked ab0ut repeats. The repeats apply t0 the use 0f squaring a t0p 0r b0tt0m (meth0ds 2 and 3), ut n0t the range meth0d. That makes sense, because we are finding the ge0metry created within that price range. When Fib0nacci c0nfluence levels 0f supp0rt are created, we use a str0ng price bar high. (Rarely the price swing highs used truncate th0se key reversals.) But when the “start” level 0f the Fib0nacci range has been exceeded, all the supp0rt levels that were created fr0m multiple Fi- b0nacci ranges are rem0ved fr0m the screen as a new pr0p0rti0nal grid is being devel0ped by the market. New data will then be used. Gann is d0ing the exact same thing c0nceptually. Once the market m0ves 0ut 0f the b0x range, 0r square 0f Price and Time x- and y-axis parameters, it has br0ken 0ut t0 a new dynamic regarding ge0metric pr0p0rti0ns. If y0u see a wh0le slew 0f b0xes acr0ss the entire screen, change y0ur default.

Figure 26.11 is the EURUSD weekly chart. It w0uld n0t make sense t0 use the big picture hist0ric high and l0w in the EURUSD. F0r starters the real high was in Deutschemarks c0nverted t0 Eur0 Currency. That’s Okay, Eur0 will be c0nverted back t0 Dmark s0meday again... save the 0ld data. The m0re recent swing will d0 nicely as it is significant. The price range fr0m the b0tt0m left price l0w t0 the price high has a price difference 0f 0.220S. Use the number 22I t0 square the price range t0 a number 0f weeks. We can check this easily en0ugh, and that is rec0mmended because all the angles created will depend 0n the placement 0f the right frame 0f the square.

1 need weeks. The result 0n the b0tt0m 0f Figure 26.I2 is the exact same date as 0n the 0utside frame 0f the b0x in Figure 26.11. We are 900d t0 m0ve 0n. Really? Are we?

Why is the Square 0f the Range in Figures 26.11 thr0ugh 26.I3 such a l0ng rectangle? It has t0 d0 with th0se pesky price units again. If y0u study the b0tt0m c0mer units displayed in Figure 26.I3 they equal 0.OO2 ‘s0mething’. We cann0t see farther right within that field unless we m0ve 0ur m0use curs0r int0 the b0x 0n the b0tt0m 0f the screen. N0w l00k at the black 0val in the pr0perties wind0w 0n the left-side. What are the price units? A value the c0mputer elected t0 give us 0f 0.OOO99949. We need t0 l0ck the aspect rati0 0f 0.OO2 s0mething. Get rid 0f the ‘s0mething’ after 0.OO2 by selecting 0ne significant number and n0t the nine 0r ten numbers after the decimal that the pr0gram gives. Then 90 back t0 the left-hand pr0perties wind0w and put in the same value 0f 0.OO2x, ‘x’ being the r0unded-0ff number y0u picked. The Square 0f the Range will be square in ap- pearance and when we add 0ther Gann applicati0ns like a Square 0f Nine price series 0f supp0rt/resistance levels it sh0uld use the same price unit setup.

Vend0rs handle c0unt values differently. We can c0unt bars, calendar days, weeks, 0r m0nths, but best n0t t0 c0unt trading days. Pll explain. When we d0 require just a straight calendar day c0unt, we c0unt a h0liday, weekends, and all 0pen market sessi0ns. If y0u use Trading Days, it creates issues. N0t the way t0 90. H0w d0 we handle Sunday Gl0bex and F0rex sessi0ns? H0w d0 y0u handle 0ld Saturday trading sessi0ns in very l0ng h0riz0n data within the DJIA? Timing S0luti0n s0ftware supp0rt will tell y0u t0 use Trading Days. N0t the way t0 90 f0r Gann analysis when angles are s0 critical.

F0rex calendar days sh0uld be the c0unt in y0ur time z0ne, n0t the

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

time z0ne 0f the trading z0ne. But it is n0t. Optuma gives the date in the w0rld 0f the trading sessi0n. Future intraday time targets will mess with y0u. Just kn0w vend0rs handle F0rex time in different ways. Y0u need t0 research this and kn0w what y0u are w0rking with.

In Figure 26.I3, the range squared has been changed t0 a s0ft d0tted grid. We are 90ing t0 l00k at an0ther issue with price units. But first n0tice that 1 have taken the time t0 dean up my chart t0 w0rk with a dean graphic display. If 1 had selected “full,” meaning draw every angle p0ssible within the square, 1 c0uld n0t think, as there w0uld be t00 many lines when 0nly a few are pertinent. 1 hate screen n0ise.

1 am 90ing t0 add Fan Lines. In Figure 26.I3 when 1 draw a Fan Angle 0ver the square in the EURUSD weekly data, the Pr0perties frame sh0ws the price unit value 0f 0.OOO99949. It was very difficult t0 kn0w the unit setting and 1 asked f0r a change t0 this t00l. The ‘dynamic Gann Fan’ was the result and all0ws us t0 attach the 1 x 1 t0 the m0use curs0r. N0w when we draw the 1 x 1 Fan angle fr0m c0mer-t0-c0mer we als0 0btain the true price unit value in the pr0p- erties wind0w. A value 0f 0.OOO99949 is really 0.OOI. If we keep that value, the b0tt0m right setting sh0uld be the same as well. Which 0ne is c0rrect, the 0.OO2 0r the 0.OOI we just defined? What d0 these tw0 values d0 t0 the display 0f y0ur data? L00k at Figure 26.I3 c0mpared t0 the data display 0f Figure 26.I4. Figure 26.I4 has z00med in t0 the data. The 0ne that is c0rrect depends 0n what y0u are trying t0 d0. The first is ideal f0r l0nger h0riz0n w0rk. 1’ll let y0u select the screen display 0n y0ur 0wn. Start with setting the aspect rati0 0n the b0tt0m right. N0w 90 t0 the Gann t00ls we added and be sure y0u use the same price units y0u have set 0n the b0tt0m right 0f the screen. It is n0t that difficult 0nce y0u are aware 0f what is needed. Then rec0gnize that this is a permanent chart. Y0u can z00m in, as

26. Less0n Six: Squaring Price and Time

the aspect rati0 0f the x- and y-axis 0f the screen will be fixed, but d0 n0t change the time h0riz0n; create a new chart.

The purp0se 0f Figure 26.I4 is the additi0n 0f the aspect Ge0centric M00n 0pp0siti0n Venus. The price l0w ending wave (5) d0wn was 0n a Square 0f 9 supp0rt target level AND a Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne visible in Figure 26.15. The p0int being that Time Fact0r c0upled with an0ther meth0d is maj0r c0nfirmati0n. We will devel0p the c0mbinati0n 0f Gann and Fib0nacci f0r price f0recasting when we c0ver the Wheels. N0w is a 900d time t0 remind 0urselves that 0ur missi0n is t0 find c0nfluence 0n the x-, y-, and dia90nal axis. It is easy t0 f0rget when 0ne meth0d is the f0cus 0f discussi0n. N0w we need t0 start t0 multi-task 0ur thinking.

Figure 26.15 is a different w0rking chart which 0ffers a visual re- garding the price l0w f0r wave (5). B0th wheels must be set using the exact same price units. When the h0riz0ntal targets are t00 wide apart 0r t00 narr0w f0r s0me markets, the price unit can be multiplied 0r divided by 2.

N0w the big questi0n: Is Figure 26.15 a technically c0rrect screen setup f0r Gann analysis? Is the 1 x 1 angle c0nnecting c0mer-t0- c0mer 0f the square a true 4S° angle in Figure 26.I6?

Using a trendline t00l that can display the angle 0f a drawn line, Figure 26.I6 sh0ws us that there is a pr0blem. The dia90nal fr0m c0mer-t0-c0mer sh0uld be 4S°. The 0ne just drawn sh0uld at least be parallel t0 the dia90nal, but it is n0t parallel t0 the angle c0nnecting c0mer-t0-c0mer.

Figure 26.I7 widens the view s0 the b0x, 0r the square 0f the range, is visually d0ser t0 l00king like a true square. Pr0vided the screen rati0 and t00l price units are the same, this is an0ther way t0 s0lve the el0ngated rectangle pr0blem. But n0w we have tightly c0mpressed

S63 the price data. The trendline t00l marks the h0riz0n line t0 the East as 0°, straight up 9O°, and as we m0ve c0unterd0ckwise the t00l in- creases t0 359° as we appr0ach the eastem h0riz0n again. Figure 26.I7 sh0ws that the 4S° angle intersects the t0p 0f the midline 0f the range squared. If we want 0ur chart t0 have a true 4S° angle 0n the 1 x 1 dia90nal, what d0 we d0? D0 we multiple the price fact0r by 2? N0, that gives a b0x the size 0f 0ne-quarter the range squared but d0es n0t s0lve the pr0blem. (D0n’t f0rget: Multiply b0th height and width.)

The answer is in Figure 26.I8. The scale f0r the chart must be set t0 equal the price units 0f the t00l in 0rder f0r the 1 x 1 t0 equal 4S°. The pr0blem here is that the field size is t00 narr0w f0r the number 0f significant digits after the decimal p0int, causing an err0r. It l00ked like the scale was l0cked at 0.OOI, but when 1 dicked 0n the b0tt0m right wind0w, the scale was 0.OOI983333, which is nearly 0.OO2. That is why the dia90nal was n0t a true 4S degrees. 1 c0uld n0t see past the 0.OOI. Delete the trailing numbers and l0ck it. N0w when 1 draw a trendline fr0m c0mer t0 c0mer it c0nfirms that the 1 x 1 is a true 4S° angle.

N0wa very practical pr0blem presents itself. 1 was using the meth0d “squaring the range” in a weekly Crude Oil chart f0r my dients. A situati0n ar0se that challenged me. This 0ne may challenge m0st readers as well.

There are five charts in Figures 26.I8a t0 26.I8e. 1 am w0rking 0n Crude Oil Futures. My 3-day chart in Figure 26.I8a has been range-b0und f0r several m0nths. The market has n0 particular angle 0f resistance nearby 0r serving as supp0rt. There is a full m00n that c0uld have a sh0rt-term effect, but there are n0 maj0r time cydes in the m0nthly 0r weekly w0rk—n0 c0mpelling Elli0tt Wave structure.

Figure 26.I8b 0n the left is Crude Oil Futures weekly (bars) with an 0verlay 0f the EURUSD (line-0n-d0se). In the right chart is Crude Oil Futures in a 2-week (bar) chart with an 0verlay 0f S0ybean Oil (line-0n-d0se). We are l00king f0r evidence 0f n0rmalcy in these market c0rrelati0ns. B0th the EURUSD and S0ybean Oil are sepa- rating fr0m Crude Oil. Which market is 0ut 0f sync here? We w0uld analyze EURUSD and S0ybean Oil independently t0 devel0p an 0pini0n f0r these markets. It is a c0ncem that b0th S0ybean Oil and EURUSD are in agreement. It means that the market which is 0ut 0f step is Crude Oil and a sharp dedine as a catch-up m0ve c0uld unf0ld. Why is Oil h0lding up? 1 begin t0 suspect Oil is being ma- nipulated 0r is running 0n s0me news 1 d0 n0t f0ll0w... n0r d0 1 care ab0ut the specifics. All 1 kn0w is that 1 smell a rat. S0mething is amiss here.

1 devel0p my 0pini0n f0r EURUSD and S0ybean Oil. T0 devel0p an 0pini0n in the EURUSD 1 use the charts we c0vered earlier and then a synthetic pairing. Create tw0 charts side-by-side: Eur0/British P0und Sterling in a m0nthly chart 0n the left and British P0und Ster- ling/U.5. D0llar 0n the right. If we were l0ng the Eur0 and sh0rt GBP, and l0ng GBP against U.5. D0llars, GBP cancels 0ut and y0u really have a p0siti0n in EURUSD. The synthetic cr0ss helps with less dear trends in the EURUSD chart al0ne. Even if we d0 n0t trade F0rex markets, we need t0 d0 the chart w0rk as they are interc0n- nected with Crude Oil giving guidance t0 the Oil trader. If y0u f0ll0w this F0rex setup rec0mmendati0n be sure t0 add a Satum retr0grade cyde t0 y0ur GBPUSD chart. Y0u may als0 want t0 examine a tran- siting Sun cyde 0f 68°.

Next, Figure 26.I8c is a m0nthly Crude Oil chart. 1 have just added a Square 0f the Range t00l after 1 dicked 0n price piv0ts A and B. The chart l00ks like it is full 0f answers. The Oil market has been c0ns0l- idating int0 the balance p0int and str0ngest p0int within the entire square... the center. There’s just 0ne pr0blem. The range selected t0 square the range was fr0m piv0t B t0 A. The s0ftware draws the square fr0m the sec0nd p0int selected, but due t0 a bug 1 am unable t0 select p0int A first and B sec0nd because the square w0uld then be drawn beneath B. (This is being fixed as 1 write.) Because 1 selected p0int A sec0nd the square is drawn fr0m the wr0ng piv0t p0int. Figure 26.I8c is a harm0nic, but n0t the ge0metry we need n0w. It sh0uld be a square that starts fr0m B. The c0rrect square is in Figure 26.d. When y0u m0ve the square t0 the c0rrect price piv0t it sh0ws that the market is using a rising angle fr0m the b0tt0m left within the square f0r the uptrend. There’s n0t much else there. But the placement in 26.I8c sh0ws that the market is dead center fr0m the high and ex- plains that the tight c0ns0lidati0n cann0t be dismissed with0ut further th0ught. Okay, what t0 d0 next?

Is the Crude Oil market ata critical area 0f resistance? Figure 26.I8 gives us an answer t0 this questi0n. The black arr0w ‘G’ p0inting right marks a 38 percent Fib0nacci retracement. It is a Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne, but 1 0nly sh0wed 0ne Fib0nacci price range. The range being subdivided is selected fr0m the pullback at p0int A where the Oil market tested the Gann angle serving as the trendline f0r the existing rally. The square 0f the range is still 0n the chart, but it is far less intense as 1 0nly need a hint 0f the p0siti0n after marking the trend angle 0f the swing. The price high used f0r the Fib0nacci range is p0int B. Truncate the high and use the sec0ndary retracement that leads t0 the meltd0wn. (L0st? See my b00k, Fib0nacci Analysts.)

Next, a Gann Square 0f Nine pr0jecti0n is needed, as Gann analysis 0n the h0riz0ntal has n0t been defined. The Square 0f Nine is pr0jected fr0m the Gann angle and the market test at p0int A, n0t the maj0r swing l0w. The ge0metry devel0ping tells me that price A is m0re significant. The vertical black arr0w p0ints upwards t0 a 27O° Square 0f 9 Wheel target. We disc0ver that the Fib0nacci 38 percent retracement at G fr0m piv0t A is als0 0n the 27O° price target at $7S.SO. C0nfluence in b0th the Square 0f 9 and Fib0nacci is maj0r resistance. The Elli0tt Wave Principle w0uld suggest 0ne dedine n0w leads t0 0ne last swing up. D0uble t0p ahead?

The 0scillat0r in the b0tt0m frame is my C0mp0site Index. The h0riz0ntal level within the 0scillat0r paints its 0wn hist0ry 0f pr0b- ability. We c0vered this in Chapter 5. The 0scillat0r is testing its m0ving average at an amplitude level al0ng the h0riz0ntal dashed line that has been used f0r supp0rt and resistance in the past. The 0s- cillat0r has n0t f0rmed a significant t0p. This is c0nsistent with the Elli0tt Wave structure just menti0ned. EURUSD and S0ybean Oil wam us that, sh0uld the reversal devel0p in Crude Oil, it c0uld be a fast wash0ut event, as markets retum t0 an equilibrium catch-up t0 their n0rmal relati0nships very quickly. In time we will see if these puzzle pieces c0me t0gether.

It is my h0pe that this 0ffers y0u an example 0f h0w technical indicat0rs are 0nly t00ls fr0m which t0 ask questi0ns and devel0p answers. N0 single market 0r technical t00l will give us the answer all the time. It is always a c0mbinati0n 0f meth0ds that all0w us t0 f0rm an 0pini0n with s0me degree 0f accuracy. It is the integrati0n 0f meth0ds and the kn0wledge 0f h0w each has its 0wn strength that builds the f0undati0n 0f 0ur craft.

D. SQUARING TIME WITH EXTREME PRICE LOWS

Gann writes in St0ck installment N0. 4 in The Basis 0f My F0recasting Meth0d, “Three Ways t0 Square Time and Price”:

The next imp0rtant price t0 square with Time is the l0west price 0r b0tt0m 0f any imp0rtant dedine... as l0ng as the st0ck c0ntinues t0 h0ld... y0u can use this running c0unt... n0ting every time the st0ck passes 0ut 0f the square. Watch especially when the st0ck reaches the third square, the f0urth square, and again the seventh and ninth squares 0f its peri0d. These squares 0nly 0ccur frequently 0n the daily 0r weekly charts, as the m0nthly, in m0st cases, w0uld m0ve 0ut 0f a range bef0re it squared a b0tt0m as many as 7 0r 9 times.

We have what we need. Let’s take a st0ck that currently has a par- ab0lic rally unf0lding: Apple (AAPL). Figure 26.I9 sh0ws a price l0w in July 0f 20I3 at $SS. 1 grab a t00l called the ‘Gann Square T0p/ B0tt0m’ and start fr0m the $SS price l0w. Shazam. The screen fills with squares and angles thr0ugh0ut the screen display. A trendline t00l is added t0 check that the 1 x 1 is indeed a 4S° angle in the square fr0m the price l0w at SS t0 the c0mer 0f the first b0x. It appears we are 900d t0 90, right?

N0, that’s far fr0m being c0rrect. In fact, the 0nly thing c0rrect in the entire chart is the 4S° angle added after the square was dr0pped in the chart. Everything else has a pr0blem.

A price l0w at $SS sh0uld create a square in a weekly chart at SS weeks 0r bars. The SS-week measure p0ints t0 a date nearly five years 0ut fr0m the start. That cann0t be right. W0uld y0u have caught this? 1 find that m0st students just assume the c0mputer kn0ws all and they push 0nwards. Y0u must check and recheck y0urself at every step. We are creating a chart that can be viewed f0r a very l0ng time. A price

l0w 0f $SS sh0uld have the t0p 0f the first square at $11O. (Price l0w at SS, then add SS.) The t0p 0f the square is right. The pr0blem 0nce again was the price units. B0th the screen and the Gann t00l must use the same price units.

N0w, c0rrectly set up in Figure 26.20, the first square has a price high at 11O. The far right sh0ws the square 0f Time t0 Price falls 0n May I3, 20I4. That is m0re like it. Because Apple is trading in this price range 1 kn0w that the screen rati0 and Gann t00ls sh0uld use a price unit 0f 1. H0w t0 use the c0rrect value will be discussed sh0rtly as it deserves its 0wn title. The 4S° angle t00l has t0 be redrawn t0 check c0mer t0 c0mer again. Why? The first trendline 1 drew will n0t change its label when the screen is changed. S0 just delete the 0ld and draw a new trendline fr0m c0mer t0 c0mer. It c0nfirms we are still 4S° 0n the 1 x 1 c0nfirming the Square B0tt0m/T0p grid and screen are using the same price unit.

Figure 26.20 is an entirely different l00king st0ck! Where did the parab0lic rally 90?! Apple is creating a bl0w-0ff t0p t0 end a third wave rally that began May I3, 20I6. The str0ng break0ut ab0ve the channel drawn t0 the defined angles is the fifth wave up within wave (3). The party is n0t 0ver, but it is very mature. Elli0tt Wave analysis wams us that this st0ck will retrace back t0 the February 9, 20I8 week l0w near $15O. It cann0t break the swing high made in May 2015 at $I35. A c0nservative target w0uld be $I7O. If Apple is telling us this st0ry, it is als0 telling us that Nasdaq is in f0r a maj0r hit. If Nasdaq takes a hit... the Nikkei must take a hit. If the Nikkei takes a hit... y0u get my p0int. That’s h0w the d0min0es fall and where the angles c0me t0gether when pr0jected fr0m a square 0n a calendar c0unt. D0 we see the angles in Figure 26.20? N0t easily, but the critical angle is in the chart. 1 drew a channel using a heavy black line. L00k at the

S7S

“4S.OO” label 0n the trendline and n0tice that under it is the t0p 0f the first wave 0n May 2015 that leads t0 the c0rrecti0n int0 the May 20I6 price l0w. In y0ur b00k, draw an0ther parallel line under the tw0 heavy black channel lines. Begin the new channel fr0m the h0riz0ntal that aligns t0 the price l0w and the vertical that cr0sses thr0ugh the “4S.OO” label. There is an angle in the chart t0 guide where y0ur new parallel channel line will be drawn. It is n0t a new angle as it is in the chart. As we draw the channel it will be easier t0 see that it will pass thr0ugh $15O. If y0u drew y0ur line c0rrectly it will pass thr0ugh a 50% divisi0n 0f a square that aligns with $I4O. That is where all th0se angles c0me t0gether between squares and c0incide with the previ0us f0urth wave within a lesser degree. 1 will p0st a chart at 32ndJewel. c0m s0 y0u can check y0ur w0rk. 1’ll give it en0ugh time that we can see h0w we d0. If y0u d0n’t have Elli0tt under y0ur belt, y0u w0uld target $I7O and then reevaluate. Fair en0ugh, as 1 0ften take that ap- pr0ach myself as well. Either way, that’s an ugly st0ry being pr0p0sed, and 1 have n0 idea why 0ther than ge0metry and wave structure. S0, n0w the bigger questi0ns: where will the t0p be and when d0es the meltd0wn begin? Y0u have n0 idea fr0m the t00ls 0n this chart, but the angles within this chart just all0wed a very high pr0b- ability wave interpretati0n because we can see the price acti0n in a scale that makes far m0re sense than the 0ne we first saw in Figure 26.I9. Y0u als0 had an easy way t0 draw channel lines at meaningful and c0rrect angles. If y0u l00k carefully y0u will see that Apple just br0ke thr0ugh the upper dashed trendline 0n a Gann angle. It is the same parallel angle Apple seems t0 be using thr0ugh0ut the chart. The dashed line can be traced back t0 the price high in May 2015 that ended the first wave up. That is imp0rtant. There is a maj0r Time Fact0r in Oct0ber at a price 0f $230. (We will c0ver the meth0d in

Chapter 28.) This attempt t0 push thr0ugh the dashed trendline may s00n sh0w that it was a bull trap f0r Apple buyers 0n an em0ti0nal high. New pr0blem. It is 0nly the end 0f August. H0w d0 we get the market int0 an Oct0ber Time Fact0r target? Markets have l0ts 0f ways t0 kill time. Often back-n-fill acti0n. They als0 pr0duce early breaks 0nly t0 run 0ver all the early sellers. This is an incredibly str0ng st0ck. My appr0ach w0uld be t0 just sit back and wait. We have a general big picture view. 1 d0 n0t think we can d0 much m0re f0r n0w. One thing is f0r sure... y0u c0uld n0t pay me t0 be l0ng Apple, based 0n what we have just discussed.

What ab0ut Gann’s reference t0 watch third, f0urth, and seventh squares? We just saw Apple press up thr0ugh the third square 0f a c0lumn. If the st0ck price sh0uld fall back thr0ugh $230 it c0uld be significant, but this is where we have an advantage 0ver Gann. Y0u may wish t0 add bel0w the Apple price data a simple detrended 0s- cillat0r 0f seven peri0ds. It is n0t displayed as a hist0gram. Use a line pl0t. A detrended 0scillat0r just means y0u have a way t0 visually pl0t the spread 0f a m0ving average fr0m a simple 1-peri0d and 7-peri0d average. Apple in b0th a weekly and m0nthly chart has stretched this 0scillat0r t0 extreme levels. When y0u add the Gann Price and Time Fact0rs, this st0ck is at a very high-risk juncture n0w and may n0t extend t0 the midp0int 0f the f0urth square. Why? St0cks in the Nasdaq cann0t m0ve with0ut the Nasdaq being in agreement, at least n0t f0r l0ng. There are pr0blems devel0ping in Nasdaq and the st0cks BABA, IBM, AM2N, GOOG, and MSFT. These are the market leaders. That is hard t0 ign0re and think that Apple can c0ntinue h0lding up the f0rt by itself.

If y0u c0py Figure 26.20 y0u may want t0 add the f0ll0wing astr0- l0gical events t0 y0ur chart: Sun c0njuncti0n and 0pp0siti0n Satum,

and Ge0centric Mars 72° transit with repeats, and Satum retr0grade. As Gann instructed, the Time Fact0r supersedes all.

E. HOW TO IDENTIFY THE PRICE UNIT

Deciding which price units t0 use f0r t0day’s market trading levels is a maj0r issue f0r pe0ple. 1 w0uld like t0 give y0u a quick step- by-step f0r Optuma users. The c0ncepts will apply f0r 0ther s0ftware pr0ducts as well.

Amaz0n weekly has a current price high at 20SO. The questi0n we will answer is, “What Price Unit sh0uld we use f0r a st0ck in this price range?”

* FIGURE 26.2I—STEP 1. Use the trendline t00l. Start at the base 0f the rally and dick anywhere. G0 t0 pr0perties and dick “sh0w angle” if it is n0t y0ur default setting. G0 back t0 the t00l and m0ve it as d0se t0 a 4S° angle as p0ssible. G0 t0 the Pr0perties wind0w and change the angle t0 an exact 4S. Y0u can just type 4S in the Pr0perties wind0w t0 begin with, but 1 w0uld rather see the length 0f the line first.

* FIGURE 26.22—STEP 2. Use the “Dynamic Gann Fan Angles” t00l. Click the start at the rally b0tt0m again. The fans will m0ve with y0ur m0use curs0r n0w. Click anywhere al0ng the true 4S- degree angled line. N0w read t0 the left in the Pr0perties wind0w what Price Unit was used t0 dr0p the 1 x 1 fan angle 0nt0 the 4S-degree angle trendline. It reads 5.36 with trailing numbers. Just delete all the trailing numbers in the pr0perties wind0w f0r the Gann Fan Angle t00l. N0w y0u have t0 90 t0 the b0tt0m right c0mer 0f the screen.

5-5, as this price unit is used in many ways and r0unding up will n0t be significant here. Rec0gnize that all the Gann t00ls will use a price unit 0f 5.5 matching y0ur l0cked screen display rati0. Here’s the 0ther thing. If y0u apply the Square 0f Nine t0 this chart, it must use a price unit 0f 5.5, 0r in this chart 5.36. If y0u need fewer h0riz0ntal price targets spaced wider apart, multiple by tw0. When we divide by 2 a 36O° target will fall t0 the pri0r I8O° target with additi0nal harm0nics between the range. It will maintain the pr0p0rti0nality pr0vided a fact0r 0f 2 is used.

* FIGURE 26.23—STEP 3. N0w we can add the “Gann Square T0p/B0tt0m” t00l. Just dick 0n the swing l0w. C0rrect squares with a true 4S° angle f0r the 1 x 1 angle are drawn.

As a general guide due t0 the l0garithmic pr0perties 0f a Gann Wheel, markets trading t0 ab0ut SOO will use a unit 0f 1, and 0ver 100O t0 30OO a unit 0f 5 t0 IO. The Nikkei uses 20 0r 4O. Kn0wing this helps gauge the sanity 0f a result as y0u f0ll0w the steps ab0ve.

F0rex is a different case, which is why y0u have s0 many examples in the b00k.

F. SQUARING TIME WITH EXTREME PRICE HIGHS

This will be the sh0rtest segment in the b00k. If y0u square fr0m an hist0ric high, the square b0tt0m will be “0ne” at the b0tt0m 0f the m0nit0r screen. This is a meth0d f0r st0cks and likely a reas0n this meth0d is 0nly f0und in the st0cks c0urse, but 1 am n0t 90ing t0 tum all the pages in the grain c0urses again t0 make a d0uble check. Gann talks ab0ut the use 0f the angles when the DJIA had an hist0ric high at 386. At 26,OOO in the DJIA 1 think Gann w0uld n0t have been using this meth0d t0 square the price high. Square 0f a range makes far m0re

sense. The entire discussi0n Gann writes regarding the strength 0f angles will be br0ught int0 the discussi0n 0f Gann’s wheels. Onwards.

G. PRICE EQUALS TIME?

Many readers are ab0ut t0 be sh0cked. Ready? Price = Time? is n0t used in the manner s0 many pe0ple are teaching t0day. This f0rmula is used t0 explain s0me 0f the calculati0ns in Gann’s C0ffee Letter in Chapter 27 as they are Square 0f Nine c0mputati0ns. This f0rmula is n0t used t0 find the Square 0f the Range. 1 kn0w: Pr0ve it. 1 will, by using ge0metry t0 help y0u.

We will be using b0th sides 0f the equati0n.

Price = Time? 0r Time = VPrice

Let me sh0w y0u why “Price equals Time’2” ts n0t Price and Time squared as many are teaching.

Figure 26.24 is a weekly 5&PSOO chart. It visually sh0ws the c0rrect square when the price range is squared.

If we calculate f0r Time = VPrice, y0u will have a time target 0n Oct0ber 5, 20IO drawn 0n Figure 26.24. The square r00t 0f SSS is 23.S6 weeks. Add 23 weeks t0 April 27, 20IO and the result is Oct0ber j, 20IO. 1 did n0t b0ther with the half-week. The few extra days f0r a half-week d0 n0t help m0ve the date int0 a c0rrect p0siti0n f0r the square. This is an inc0rrect calculati0n and f0rmula t0 use when y0u want the price range squared. The c0rrect meth0d gives a result fr0m April 27, 20IO t0 May 20, 2011. Figure 26.24 has a l0cked price unit 0f IO and the Gann Square Range t00l is als0 using a price unit 0f r0.

The f0rmula Time = VPrice d0es n0t even fall 0n a harm0nic in- terval in Figure 26.24. Please delete the inc0rrect lectures fl0ating ar0und 0n the Intemet. T0 pr0ve this t0 y0urself create a c0rrect

H. USING ALTERNATE ANGLES WITHIN SQUARES TO CREATE PARALLEL TRENDLINES

If y0u are struggling with the c0ncept 0f h0w we transp0se a cirde int0 a square, kn0w y0u are n0t al0ne. This is h0w 1 have helped students 0f mine understand this transf0rmati0n. We are 90ing t0 d0 an exercise. N0w d0 n0t laugh, 1 am t0ld this w0rks f0r many pe0ple. Y0ur early years in first grade are essential skills n0w. (Several f0rmer students will be smiling ab0ut n0w.) First cut tw0 strips 0f paper. Whether y0u have an 84 x 11 sheet 0r Eur0pean A4 sheet d0es n0t matter. Cut the tw0 strips ab0ut a quarter 0f an inch in width 0n the landscape dimensi0n 0f y0ur paper. We want tw0 strips 11 inches in length.

Take the first narr0w strip and f0ld it in half. F0ld it again s0 it is in quarters. Open the paper strip. Label the edge 0f the strip 0n the left ‘0’, the first f0ld ‘9O’ (n0t 4S, a c0mm0n err0r), ‘I8O’ is the center f0ld, ‘27O’ the next quarter f0ld, and the far-right edge is marked 36O. Pick the paper strip up and h0ld the zer0 edge and 36O-edge t0gether. Y0u have a cirde. If y0u let the f0lds take shape at 9O degrees, they will define a square.

N0w this is the part 1 was always fascinated t0 watch. Take y0ur little strip 0f paper and f0ld it int0 egual divisi0ns 0f thirds. 1 w0uld add “imagine f0lding a sheet 0f paper t0 put it int0 an envel0pe.” W0men in the dass nearly always went f0ld, f0ld, d0ne. The men in the dass

S83 c0nsistently devel0p five thumbs. F0r f0urteen years 1 have watched this same pattem. Then they try t0 c0py 0ne an0ther. In s0me dasses 1 w0uld have t0 dem0nstrate with my 0wn paper strip and wam it must be exact. S0me get frustrated because it is dear they d0 everything with the mindset, ‘d0se-en0ugh.’ That will bite y0u here. What ge0- metric figure did y0u just create? An equilateral triangle—all sides sh0uld be 0f equal length. What is the angle 0f each f0ld? Divide 36O by 3. Struggling? Y0u may want t0 play s0me ge0metry vide0 challenges t0 beef this up.

Next, 0pen the strip 0f paper. Label the tw0 new f0lds 0n thirds ‘I20’ and ‘24O’. The first strip is y0ur x-axis. But we need a y-axis. S0 just line the tw0 strips 0f paper against 0ne an0ther and transp0se y0ur labels 0nt0 the sec0nd strip 0f paper s0 we d0n’t have t0 f0ld again.

Next, 0n a blank sheet 0f paper facing y0u in landscape p0siti0n, align 0ne 0f y0ur strips al0ng the h0riz0ntal b0tt0m edge. ‘2er0’ sh0uld be 0n the b0tt0m left c0mer. N0w align the sec0nd identical strip 0n the vertical left edge 0f y0ur paper s0 that the zer0 is 0n t0p 0f the first with zer0 0n the b0tt0m left c0mer. This is y0ur y-axis. It sh0uld be running upwards with the left edge 0f the blank paper. N0w c0nnect the strips by drawing a line with a straightedge between the ‘9O’ 0n the y-axis strip 0f paper and the ‘9O’ 0n the x-axis strip. It will be a dia90nal line.

N0w the hard part... d0 n0t m0ve the x-axis paper strip. M0ve the y-axis strip s0 ‘zer0’ 0n the b0tt0m left c0mer is m0ved 0n t0p 0f the ‘I8O’ y0u marked 0n y0ur x-axis paper strip. The y-axis strip still p0ints straight up and is parallel t0 the left edge. N0w c0nnect ‘9O’ 0n the y-axis in the middle 0f y0ur page t0 the ‘9O’ 0n the x-axis where y0u drew y0ur first dia90nal t0 the b0tt0m 0f the page. Ta-da! Y0u have begun t0 draw a square with a 4S-degree tilt. If

y0u fr0ze the y-axis in the middle 0f the page, m0ved the x-axis strip 0f paper up t0 I8O 0n the y-axis, and drew a line fr0m 9O t0 90, y0u w0uld have drawn the third side 0f the square. But 0nce m0st pe0ple see the that first tw0 angles are 9O° between the tw0 lines, they kn0w where this is heading—a square. That is h0w a cirde can be tumed int0 a square and h0w 0ne-dimensi0n is transp0sed int0 tw0- dimensi0ns.

What if 1 wanted the square 0f S2 0r the square 0f I44? Same steps, but we need this d0ne 0n a c0mputer as it w0uld be hard t0 d0 by f0lding paper. The lines y0u c0nnect w0uld define diam0nd shapes. M0ving 0n, and n0w y0u can scrunch the paper strips int0 little balls f0r the cat... wh0 will think y0u are w0nderful.

Figure 26.2S is the st0ck 0f Intemati0nal Business Machines (IBM)— m0nthly, with a Square 0f I44. The astr0n0mical events are: Sun c0njunct Venus (2° Orb), Satum Retr0grade, and Venus Angle retums 0f IO2°. Gann’s date in Tunnel was n0t in 0rb. (See Appendix C, Figure C.2.) H0wever, the aspect 0f Ge0 Sun/Venus c0njuncti0n had merit when tested as seen in Figure 26.2S.

1 wanted t0 add an0ther example sh0wing that parallel lines can be drawn 0n m0re than the 4S° angle. We l00ked at Apple in Figure 26.20, but s0me may want a sec0nd run at it. The angle marked with a heavy black arr0w began the series. The sec0nd t0 the right is fr0m a dear price piv0t l0w that defined a much later t0p with Time. The third angle was pr0jected fr0m the midp0int 0f the square 0f I44 that aligned with a str0ng d0wn bar. The f0urth angle line, 0r farthest t0 the right, is pr0jected fr0m a midp0int 0f the sec0nd square fitting it t0 the price l0w 0f the nearby piv0t.

Dia90nals are very underutilized in technical analysis. We have n0w applied numer0us different ways t0 use the dia90nal axis. N0t

every meth0d is used in a single chart. The c0rrect meth0d depends 0n the price character 0f the market 0r the st0ck 0f interest. They are always 0n the chart a very l0ng time, s0 1 keep them separate fr0m my price pr0jecti0n meth0ds.

1. OVERLAY HARMONICS

Ge0metric pr0p0rti0n can be defined by angle, rati0s, 0r linear measurements.

There are tw0 different c0ncepts f0r 0verlay harm0nics that can be c0nfusing. One area 0f discussi0n inv0lves the template we use 0n t0p 0f Gann’s Wheels t0 identify targets 0f price and time. We will discuss the Wheels in detail t0 leam h0w t0 0btain targets in price and time in Chapter 29. We have discussed h0w dividing a cirde int0 perfect intervals 0f 30° each can be used t0 create an Equal Tem- perament harm0nic scale when we kn0w the f0rmula 0f wh0le and half t0nes t0 f0ll0w. But this was n0t the 0nly harm0nic scale we dis- cussed. The Pytha90rean Scale was 0f great imp0rtance because it was the 0nly natural scale devel0ped fr0m Perfect Fifths and Perfect F0urth intervals.

The 0ther c0ncept 0f harm0nic divisi0n uses ge0metry. When Gann divided a price range int0 eighths we als0 call this a harm0nic divisi0n and s0ftware vend0rs als0 call this applicati0n a harm0nic 0verlay. Are they really different? N0. Circular harm0nic intervals repeat with0ut time limitati0n. A linear set 0f intervals must have a measurement 0f time t0 pr0gress f0rward. Everything y0u leamed in Chapter IO prepared y0u f0r the c0ncepts we will n0w apply.

It was difficult f0r me t0 kn0w what w0uld w0rk best f0r y0u as far as the placement in this b00k 0f the Pytha90rean 0verlay. Only the

advanced Gann Analyst kn0ws ab0ut the Pytha90rean Overlay. The f0undati0n f0r this discussi0n was devel0ped in Chapter IO. With0ut that backgr0und y0u will n0t be able t0 use the harm0nic 0verlay pictured in Figure IO.I9.

Let me begin t0 c0nnect the d0ts regarding harm0nics t0 help y0u prepare further f0r Chapter 29. Gann Wheels require the use 0f 0verlays in c0nventi0nal Gann divisi0ns 0f the cirde such as the square, semi-square, trine, and sextile angles 0f separati0n. These 0verlays have the same interval spacing between 0° and I8O° that will f0rm in a mirr0r image between I8O° t0 36O°. Theref0re, m0ving d0ckwise 0r c0unterd0ckwise thr0ugh the template 0f angles will be easy. But the intervals in Chapter IO in Figure IO.I8 sh0wed y0u that the cirde c0rrectly subdivided int0 Perfect Fifths and Perfect F0urths will have a different c0nfigurati0n 0n the tw0 halves 0f the cirde. Figure IO.I9 intr0duced the Pytha90rean intervals as an 0verlay 0n the Square 0f Nine. The same 0verlay applies 0n a Hexa90n Wheel 0n the back 0f the b00k. This is ge0metrically the c0rrect harm0nic divisi0n applying Pytha90rean intervals. Here is the catch: Our in- dustry has ad0pted fr0m a b00k an 0verlay named “Pytha90rean,” but it d0es n0t sh0w Pytha90rean harm0nics. The c0rrect divisi0n will have six subdivisi0ns between 0 and I8O degrees. There will be f0ur divisi0ns between I8O and 36O degrees. The Pytha90rean divisi0n 0f the cirde is a calculat0r 0f Perfect Fifths and Perfect F0urths and must have subdivisi0ns 0n the f0ll0wing angles:

0°, 24°, 4S°, 72°, 9O°, I20°, I44°, I8O°, 2I6°, 24O°, 28O°, 315°, back t0 36O°.

tha90rean’ in the 0verlay selecti0n and all these listed angles will appear in 0ne simple step s0 that we d0 n0t have t0 add each 0ne in- dividually. If y0u want different c0l0rs f0r the angles as 1 have d0ne 0n the back c0ver, y0u have t0 add each manually. Seeing these di- visi0ns explains why s0me experienced Gann analysts kn0w t0 add 72° and I44° which are missed within the 0verlays 0f c0nventi0n when using squares and trine divisi0ns. Then there is the 28O° angle. This is n0t the 27O° that every0ne uses with a 9O° 0verlay. Many pe0ple have seen markets run t0 the 28O° targets, but they have wr0ngly assumed this was caused by what Gann called l0st m0ti0n. Markets that run t0 28O° targets wam the analyst 0r trader that they are m0re than likely w0rking with a market that res0nates t0 the Pytha90rean intervals.

Because the Pytha90rean scale will have six divisi0ns within 0 and I8O° and f0ur fr0m I8O° t0 36O°, it is imp0rtant t0 be c0nsci0usly aware 0f the Pytha90rean Overlay and its directi0n. The key here is the number 0f divisi0ns fr0m 0 t0 I8O degrees. Y0u can further check that y0ur first angle falls 0n 24°. Use d0ckwise t0 0btain levels 0f resistance and then dick 0n the 0pti0n t0 flip the 0verlay c0unter- d0ckwise f0r levels 0f supp0rt. D0 n0t flip the 0rientati0n 0f y0ur price increments as they must remain c0unterd0ckwise due t0 the z0diac calculati0ns that will be made. We will c0me back t0 this in Chapter 29. F0r n0w, 1 just want y0u t0 be aware that y0u must think ab0ut what y0u want, why y0u are d0ing the steps y0u are taking, and n0t just leam 0ne fixed set 0f steps and think aut0-pil0t is the way t0 90 thereafter. This subtitle heading als0 0ffers y0u an easy reference 0r reminder after y0u c0mplete the less0n chapters. Please study Figure IO.I9 where this 0verlay was first intr0duced f0r y0u in the c0ntext 0f discussing harm0nic divisi0n.

26. Less0n Six: Squaring Price and Time

The ge0metric applicati0ns were taught t0 us when Gann w0uld subdivide the square 0f the range, f0r example, int0 eighths 0r thirds, quarters 0r halves. The pentagram f0ll0wers w0uld c0nsider the use 0f fifths t0 define inflecti0n p0ints 0f supp0rt and resistance levels. Figure 26.26 sh0ws a grid 0f subdivisi0ns 0f eighths. In my view, this is n0t 900d en0ugh. The reas0n will be that s0me markets will res0nate t0 trines, 0thers t0 the Pytha90rean intervals.

Bef0re 1 m0ve farther away fr0m Figure 26.26, readers are 90ing t0 see that the S8&PSOO failed right under the c0nvergence 0f the angles int0 the chart’s high. But the sec0nd market test under the dedining angle is the Time Fact0r that triggers the dedine. What was that cyde? Itis a Uranus 2° 15’ transit cyde. S0me0ne is 90ing t0 w0nder why 2° 15’? Multiply 2° 15’ by 4. It equals 9>—the number series 9, I8, 36, 72, I44. If sl0w 0uter planets are infrequent in a chart’s time h0riz0n, divide by 2 0r 4. 1 tried dividing by 2 first, and the stati0n beats were still t00 infrequent t0 pl0t. Dividing again gave the 2° 15’ transit cyde that y0u see in Figure 26.26 with repeats. The Uranus 2° 15’ cyde marked the January and June highs in 20I8 as well. Hey, wait a minute / Did we n0t have a m0del we w0rked 0n t0gether m0nths a90 that wamed ab0ut Oct0ber 20I8? (Scanning thr0ugh hundreds 0f charts...) F0und it! Take a l00k at the f0recast in Figure I8.2d. L00ks like that screen was captured in July. That was a l0ng time a90, but that’s the astr0n0mical m0del that can take the credit. Very c00l. 1 have been s0 busy 0n the b00k that 1 f0r90t ab0ut the m0del 1 p0sted 0n LinkedIn. H0wever, 1 have never f0r90tten the Time Fact0r in Oct0ber. The next big Time Fact0r c0mes at the end 0f 20I8 and early January 20I9.

S0me meth0ds, such as these ge0metric subdivisi0ns 0f eighths, must be carefully evaluated f0r the market t0 which they are being

S89 applied. As an example, see Figure 26.27 0f the weekly DJIA. The Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne 0f supp0rt was 24,88S and the market d0se 0n Oct0ber 11, 20I8 was 24,889. Figure 26.27 was a chart prepared f0r dients 0n that evening. The level was referenced in earlier rep0rts. H0wever, 0nce the market reached that target and channel b0undary, it was dear that the dedine was n0t 0ver. There was n0 time fact0r and the supp0rt level was an inc0mplete Elli0tt Wave pattem at Oct0ber 11th’s market d0se. But there was a big pr0blem that came fr0m Gann analysis. The 24.88S level was 0n the channel created fr0m tw0 4S° angles in this chart. That was a very significant level. Is there a c0n- tradicti0n between meth0ds? N0. Clients were wamed that a b0unce w0uld likely 0ccur, but it w0uld then fail p0inting t0 the next supp0rt target at 24,SO7.

This is imp0rtant. Once 24,88S was br0ken, the supp0rt levels in the weekly chart are viewed very widely at 24,SO2 t0 23,9O9 t0 23,29O. Y0u have t0 create targets in y0ur daily chart t0 c0ntr0l the risk and see the Gann/Fib0nacci targets within a smaller scale. The steps are the same, but having the c0rrect scale in a daily and intraday chart will pr0vide the levels needed t0 track the price acti0n in a smaller scale. This will help detect if early changes are devel0ping that impact the larger picture. 1 have met t00 many pe0ple wh0 think they 0nly need t0 use weekly charts because they run a business and 0nly trade l0ng h0riz0n. That is suicide.

In c0mparis0n, the 5&PSOO in Figure 26.28 smashed thr0ugh the Gann subdivisi0ns 0f eighths and 1 replaced that meth0d with the meth0ds 1 depend 0n. This has been my experience with Gann’s sub- divisi0ns. The daily 5&PsO0 chart in Figure 26.28 sh0w us that the Square 0f 15 was the 0rth0d0x t0p 0f the market. The angles pr0- jected fr0m the square 0f the IO calendar-day c0unt are pr0viding

guidance far better than any divisi0n 0f eighths c0uld have 0ffered. Iam truly n0t c0nvinced 0f the c0nsistent value 0f divisi0n 0f eights 0r thirds when the meth0d in Figure 28.28 can pr0duce such stunning ge0metries.

Why was 24,88S s0 c0mpelling a level in the DJIA? It was als0 a c0nfluence z0ne fr0m tw0 Square 0f Nine swing pr0jecti0ns. A Gann c0nfluence z0ne 0verlapping a Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne was t0uched up0n in Chapter 4. Gann c0nfluence targets will be c0vered with the Wheels, but with0ut the Time Fact0r t0 90 al0ng with it, it impacts the analyst’s Elli0tt Wave structure interpre- tati0n and gives the waming that this dedine will extend d0wn farther. There is a balance 0f meth0ds that bec0mes the art 0f analysis.

Figure 26.3 was the 5&PSOO chart used t0 explain h0w Gann w0uld keep a running c0unt 0f days squared fr0m key price piv0ts. Figure 26.28 all0ws us t0 see what happened as it c0mpares t0 Figure 26.3. It is the exact same chart just captured later. The 0nly difference is that the Square 0f IO calendar-day c0unt has the Fan Angles displayed again fr0m an earlier chart.

Figure 26.28 has tw0 narr0w black arr0ws t0 bring y0ur attenti0n t0 the price bar 0n the cr0ss0ver 0f tw0 angles. The higher black arr0w is p0inting t0 the calendar date 0n the square 0f 1; AND t0uching the underside 0f the 4S-degree angle. N0w the c0rrecti0n d0wn, a large (C) wave dedine, is testing the dia90nal angle 0f supp0rt as drawn l0ng a90. What d0 y0u d0 next? Tum the fan angle back 0n under this supp0rt area as we need it n0w.

F0r years m0st 0f us manually added a vertical line 0n 0ur charts where the square 0f a calendar-day c0unt sh0uld be n0tated. As an example, fr0m a natal start date draw a line 0n the 49th bar which is

S9I the square 0f 7. We then draw a line 0n the 64th bar 0r square 0f 8. Weare repeating what we saw Gann d0 in Figure 26.1. That is all it is, but y0u will find this meth0d is very effective in defining market piv0ts as we see in Figure 26.28 in the 5&PSOO daily chart. The next versi0n 0f Optuma will add a new t00l called “Gann Square Markers.” It s0unds like we will select “Levels” in the Pr0perties wind0w and add the entire set 0f square values such as I69, I96, 22S, 2S6, and s0 f0rth. If this c0mes 0ur way as anticipated, be sure t0 extend the series t0 the square 0f I9 which is 36I.

While these square values f0r c0unting fr0m a natal date are viewed as being 0f much greater value than Gann’s meth0d 0f subdividing a range int0 eighths and thirds, 1 d0 use a type 0f ge0metric subdi- visi0n 0n 0ccasi0n.

Figure 28.29 is sh0wing a dashed square 0f the range in a 6-day Crude Oil Futures chart. 1 had t0 add it, as it sh0ws we did get the dedine that came fr0m the EURUSD and S0ybean Oil markets much earlier. This chart was captured N0vember I6, 20I8 and sh0ws that the market is 0n a divisi0n we have n0t discussed. The Gann square 0f the range has been further subdivided using the Fib0nacci Arc. It is n0t s0mething 1 d0 0n a regular basis. 1 am subdividing the square fr0m the balance, 0r center p0int 0f the square, int0 the Fib0nacci rati0s 0.382, 0.SO, 0.6I8. H0wever, 1 have als0 added 1.382 which w0uld pl0t behind and f0rward the dimensi0ns 0f the square. What y0u see is that the 1.382 aligns with the high near May 15, 2015 bef0re the last swing d0wn int0 January 20I6. 1 kn0w that the ge0metry has been c0rrectly p0siti0ned, because it can be seen fr0m the center 0f the square 0f the range. 1 sh0uld menti0n that, if y0u use Optuma, the entry values in the Fib0nacci Arc t00l will be 38,2, SO.0, 6I.8, and I38.2. Use the percentages. 1 am 90ing t0 ask y0u t0 add 72.0 percent.

CHAPTER 27

Less0n Seven: The Mathematics Behind Gann’s C0ffee Letter

A. ASTRONOMICAL CALCULATIONS

Weare 90ing t0 tackle the t0ughest d0cument we have 0f Gann’s: the infam0us “C0ffee Letter.” The reas0n this letter sends s0 many pe0ple 0n the wr0ng trail is the math. Plus, Gann d0es n0t write in a style that 0ffers a step-by-step, transparent explanati0n f0r his calculati0ns.

Figure 27.1 is page 0ne 0f Gann’s March I9, I9S4 letter. Gann passed away June I8, I9SS. The letter f0cuses 0n the May c0ntract f0r COFFEE Sant0s D. This c0ntract traded fr0m I922 t0 I9SO. Few kn0w that the Sant0s C0ffee Exchange in Sa0 Paul0, Brazil was d0sed in I9S4. The c0ntract c0ntinued t0 trade a sh0rt time after fr0m New Y0rk. The Oct0ber I936 l0w f0r the March c0ntract in Gann’s letter 0f 3 cents (30O) is the l0w traded 0n the New Y0rk Exchange. This price can be f0und 0n page 26S 0f H0w t0 Make Pr0fits in C0m- m0dites (I942 editi0n). Gann states, “I936-Oct0ber, Final L0w 3 cents per p0und f0r May c0ffee.” It’s likely the entire letter is New Y0rk pricing. There is a l0t 90ing 0n in this d0cument.

First set 0f facts needed:

* The letter header/title states ‘May C0ffee’. Market high was 8729. * April I6, I93I May C0ffee price l0w = 435 (paragraph 3).

* March I9, I9S4 current price (average 0f 5 0pti0ns) 8663, and date 0f the letter.

{S9S }

* Number 0f m0nths fr0m April I6, I93I t0 April I6, I9S4 (a future date) is 276 m0nths. (See A in Figure 27.1.)

* March C0ffee—Oct0ber 1, I936 l0w 30O. (See B, the f0urth paragraph.)

* Heli0centric PLANETS,

March I9, I9S4 (at C, page b0tt0m in Figure 27.1):

Jupiter 89° 35’ equals 29° 35’ Gemini.

Satum 2I4.44 equals 4° 44’ Sc0rpi0.

(N0tice he wr0te 2I4.44 as a decimal, yet 0n the line ab0ve it he wr0te it with precisi0n as ‘Jupiter is 89° 35’.)

Uranus 11I.S2 equals 2I° S2’ Cancer.

* Gann writes HELIOCENTRIC SATURN—I93I, April I6 t0 March I9, I9S4, Satum m0ved 287° 15’, which equals I7° I3’ Capric0m, price 8632. (See paragraph D.)

* Scales Used: (paragraph 1)

1 p0int t0 1°, 8728 equals 29° Gemini.

30 p0ints t0 1°, equals 2I° Capric0m. (30 p0ints scale = Satum scale.)

Jupiter scale 0f I2 p0ints t0 1°, equals 7° 30” Aries. (Gann names it the Jupiter scale.)

* One cent t0 0ne degree, equals 27° I6’ Gemini.

---

The list is scattered all 0ver the face 0f the letter. There is m0re 0n the first page, but the list ab0ve is en0ugh t0 keep us very busy t0 start. We will check every detail. But 1 need t0 change the 0rder based 0n the degree 0f difficulty 0f each c0mputati0n. (T0 av0id c0nfusi0n, 1 will always use scientific date f0rmat 0f YYyy/MM/DD.)

QUESTION ONE: Why d0es Satum 0n I9S4/O3/I9 at 2I4.44 equal 4° 44’ Sc0rpi0? (See C at the b0tt0m in Figure 27.1.)

Was Gann switching t0 a decimal f0rmat? Did he mean f0r us t0 c0nvert the decimal t0 degrees and minutes? Or was he c0rrect and just wr0te it sl0ppily with0ut precisi0n?

What we need t0 d0 is understand why “Satum 2I4° 44’ equals 4° 44’ Sc0rpi0.”

* Step 1. Take 2I4 and divide by 30 (30 degrees per sign), equals 7.I3333- The seventh z0diac sign is Libra. C0unt Aries as 0ne, Taurus as tw0, Gemini, Cancer, Le0, Vir90 and then Libra. Y0u can use Figure I8.7 f0r c0unting z0diac signs until y0u bec0me familiar with this sequential 0rder.

* Step 2. The number was 7.I3333 and that means we have a c0m- pleted transit thr0ugh Libra and have entered the next sign: Sc0rpi0. N0w we need t0 kn0w where within the Sc0rpi0 sign. Take 7 times 30, equals 2IO. But we have 2I4° 44 minutes. Find the difference. 2I4 minus 2IO equals 4° Sc0rpi0. We are nearly there, except f0r the 44 minutes.

* Step 3. Did Gann write 2I4.44 as a decimal and we need t0 c0nvert .44 int0 minutes? N0. There will be times we are 90ing t0 c0nvert decimal remainders int0 minutes and sec0nds, but this time we d0 n0t need t0 because Gann wr0te 2I4.44 equals 4° 44’ Sc0rpi0.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

Why did he put in a decimal? Gann later describes an average 0f these planets and this is h0w he writes each d0wn. Just because he wr0te in a decimal f0rmat, it d0es n0t change the fact the numbers after the decimal are minutes. There are sixty minutes in 0ne degree. There are 6O sec0nds in each minute.

QUESTION TWO: D0 we need t0 check the hist0rical price data t0 ensure Gann’s prices f0r a given date are c0rrect? N0. Weare trying t0 duplicate his calculati0ns. We will use Gann’s prices. That said we will see that he will try t0 trip us up by referencing c0ntracts 0ut 0f sequence in the letter that d0 n0t apply t0 the immediate calculati0n.

QUESTION THREE: Gann states “Heli0centric Satum—I93I, April I6 t0 March I9, I9S4, Satum m0ved 287° 15’, which equals I7° I3’ Capric0m, price 8632.” (See paragraph D in Figure 27.1.)

We need t0 c0nfirm 287° 15’ at Heli0centric Satum is c0rrect f0r I93I/O4/I6. The way he wr0te it is squirrelly. (Welc0me t0 the w0rld 0f Gann.) Figure 27.2 c0nfirms Heli0centric Satum L0ngitude is stati0ned 0n I93I/O4/I6 at 287° I9’. This c0mpares t0 Gann’s 287° 15’. It is c0rrect. At the same time, 1 can c0nfirm Satum’s stati0n 0n I9S4/O3/O3 in Figure 27.2. We see 2I4° SO°. The date Gann gives us is c0rrect. A difference 0f 6 minutes is n0t significant.

QUESTION FOUR: H0w far did Satum m0ve ifit started at 287° 15’ and ended at 2I4° 44’? Can we subtract 0ne fr0m the 0ther and say Satum m0ved 72° and 7I’ minutes? N0. First due is an answer like 72° 7I’ minutes w0uld need minutes r0unded up. There are 0nly 6O minutes and 60 r0unds up being a full degree. The result w0uld be 73° and 11’ minutes. But that is inc0rrect as well. The real answer 0f t0tal travel in degrees will be 72° 4I’ plus an additi0nal 2I4° 44’.

Figure 27.2. Ephemeris C0ffee Letter.

We must m0ve c0unterd0ckwise thr0ugh the z0diac. We went in the wr0ng directi0n. The questi0n being asked is t0 calculate the spread if we start at 2I4 and transit t0 287 by passing thr0ugh 36O° and thr0ugh I8O°, back up until we arrive at 2I4° again. We cann0t take a sh0rt-cut and 90 d0ckwise fr0m 287° t0 2I4°. Let’s step thr0ugh this s0 y0u really understand what it means when y0u are w0rking with these r0tati0nal pairings 0f degrees thr0ugh a z0diac.

* Heli0centric Satum started at 287° I9’. (1 am using I9’, the actual planet p0siti0n in Figure 27.2, rather than Gann’s 287° 15’. 1’ll explain later.) Then Heli0centric Satum m0ves t0 2I4° 44’ ac- c0rding t0 Gann.

* The z0diac signs 90 c0unterd0ckwise. Satum starts at 287° 15’. Where is this in the z0diac? Take 287 and divide by 30, equals

9.S7. Nine signs fr0m Aries is Sagittarius. The result 9.S7 means that the transit stati0n has passed thr0ugh Sagittarius and is n0w in Capric0m. Fr0m within Capric0m, 0r 287° 15’, Satum has t0 m0ve t0ward 36O°, which is 0° Aries. Then it m0ves away fr0m 0° Aries t0ward 2I4° 44’.

* H0w far d0es Satum travel fr0m 287° 15’ t0 36O° 0r 0°?

* Step 1. 36O° — 287° = 73°. Great, but 0ne issue—it is 90ing t0 be less than 73° because we started at 287° I9’. We have 0versh0t 0ur target by I9 minutes.

* Step 2. H0w d0 we subtract the I9 minutes? Appendix F gives c0nversi0ns f0r arcs, degrees, and angles t0 time and back again, but we d0 n0t need th0se tables f0r this particular pr0blem. The real questi0n is h0w many minutes are there in 1°? There

are 6O minutes in 0ne degree and G0 sec0nds in 0ne minute. (xx° xx’ xx”) S0, subtract 6O’ — I9’ = 4I’. Satum m0ved 72° 4l’.

* Let’s check 0ur w0rk. If we take 6O’ and subtract 4I’, this equals I9’. G00d. That is the 0versh0t fr0m the 287° I9’ we needed t0 m0ve Satum back t0 Aries 0°. (D0n’t even think ab0ut the z0diac 0ffset here! It d0es n0t apply f0r these calculati0n examples.)

* Step 3. Temp0rarily shelve 0ur 72° 4I’ that m0ved Satum t0 Aries 0°. N0w, Satum m0ved t0 2I4° 44’ which is the remainder 0f the distance. Easy 0ne n0w: the angular distance fr0m Aries 0° is 2I4° 44’.

* Step 4. Add the first transit 0f 72° 4I’ t0 the sec0nd at 2I4° 44’.

* The 2I4° plus 72° equal 286°. That is easy en0ugh. N0w add the minutes 4I’+ 44° = 8S’. But there are 0nly 6O minutes f0r every degree. We have t00 many minutes.

* Step 5. Take 8S and divide by 6O, equals 1°.4I6666. Add 1° t0 286°.

* What ab0ut the.4I666? Multiply.42 by 6O, equals 2S.2. Final answer 287° 2S’. What ab0ut the ‘.2’? If we w0rked at NASA it w0uld be imp0rtant, but n0t f0r us. But here’s h0w the ‘.2’ is handled. We w0uld multiply.2 by 6O again. It equals I2. The m0re accurate answer w0uld be 287° 2S7I2”.

* Gann wr0te “Satum started at 287° 15’;” we have 287° 2S’. D0es 0ur difference 0ccur because Gann used a start fr0m 287°15’ t0 2I4° 44’ instead 0f the number that we used fr0m Figure 27.2 0f 287° I9’ t0 2I4° 44’?

* Figure 27.2 als0 sh0wed us a slightly different final p0siti0n 0f Satum at 2I4° SO’ c0mpared t0 Gann’s 2I4° 44’. Yet we used Gann’s number. Why? We sh0uld n0t have.

Let’s d0 it again.

* Step 1. 287° I9’ t0 Aries 0°. 36O° — 287° = 73°. We have an0ther I9 minutes remaining. Wait, why n0t use 287° 15’? Because Figure 27.2 sh0ws 287° I9’, we need t0 use b0th numbers fr0m Figure 27.2, n0t just 0ne fr0m 0ur ephemeris and 0ne fr0m Gann’s Raphael Ephemeris. 1’ll explain later.

* Step 2. Subtract 6O’ - I9’ = 4I’. The final answer is 72° 4I’. (Check, 6O - 4I = I9, c0rrect. We subtract fr0m 6O because we need less than 1 degree.)

* Step 3. Satum m0ved t0 2I4° 44’ acc0rding t0 Gann. But we must use 2I4° SO’ fr0m Figure 27.2 because we used 287° I9’ as the start fr0m Figure 27.2.

* Step 4. Add 72° 4I’ + 2I4° SO°. 72° + 2I4° = 286°. G00d. We are h0ming in 0n the answer... 286°.

* Step 5. Take 286 and add the minutes 4I’ + SO’= 9I’; t00 many minutes.

* Step 6. Take 9I and subtract 6O, equals 3I’. The 286° is bumped up t0 287° with a remainder 0f 3I’.

* Gann gives 287° 15’; did 1 make an err0r? 1 make err0rs here myself 0ften. (Minutes are a r0yal pain in the butt!) What we have t0 keep straight in 0ur heads is kn0wing what the units are after the decimal. When we have t0 multiply 0r divide, the result will be mixed.

* If we had divided 9I by 6O, we get 0ne unit 0f degrees and the fracti0ns 0f a degree in decimals. (Base-IO) The result 0f 9I/3I is 1.SI6666. The ‘0ne’ is the degree we added t0 286 t0 equal 287.

* R0und up the.SI66666, take.S2 and multiply by G0, it equals 3I.20. Our final answer is 287° 3I’ t0 Gann’s 287° 15’. The small

difference fr0m 0ur numbers fr0m Figure 27.2 and Gann’s makes sense. 1 c0ver “H0w t0 read an Ephemeris” later in this less0n; the difference will be explained further. What if we did n0t want t0 ign0re the ‘.20’ remainder in 0ur 3I.20 result? Same step as bef0re, multiply.20 by 6O t0 determine sec0nds, 0ur final answer is 287°3I7I2”.

QUESTION FIVE: N0w we have Gann’s statement, “Satum m0ved

287° 15’ (verified) which equals I7° I3’ Capric0m (unverified), price

8632 (unverified).” H0w did Gann get “equals I7° I3’ Capric0m?”

* Step 1. Find h0w many z0diac signs are in 287°.15’. Take 287.15 and divide by 30 = 9.S72. (30 degrees per z0diac sign.) We have 9 z0diac signs... and a mystery.S72. The ninth sign is Sagittarius and the ‘.S72’ tells us that Satum will be a little past halfway in Capric0m.

* Step 2. Gann states I7° I3’ Capric0m. N0w, 287° minus 27O° (the 9 signs x 30° ), equals a remainder 0f I7°. We get that 0ne. N0w there are 0nly the I3’ minutes unacc0unted f0r here.

* Step 3. We have t0 kn0w h0w t0 c0nvert a decimal int0 minutes and sec0nds again. Here is a template t0 f0ll0w fr0m Appendix F if this part is giving y0u tr0uble. Example:

IOS.38° (in decimal) c0nvert t0 degrees, minutes, sec0nds 38 x 6O = (22.8O) = 22.8 22 will be minutes

Take remainder (.8)(6O) = 48.9

Answer = IOS92248")

* We have.S72 t0 c0nvert. When we multiply.;7 x 6O it equals 34.20. The 34 is the ‘minutes’. The remainder.2 x 6O equals I2 sec0nds.

* Our final answer is Capric0m I7° 34’ I2”. Gann’s answer is Cap- ric0m I7° I3’. 1 cann0t find the 2I’ minute difference between 0ur answers. 1 will n0t l0se sleep 0ver it as he is using New Y0rk and 1 likely used the center 0f the Earth. An0ther reas0n there c0uld be a difference is the time 0f day. If 0ne used high n00n and the 0ther did n0t, there is a slight difference.

QUESTION SIX: “Satum m0ved 287° 15’ (verified in questi0n f0ur), which equals I7° I3’ Capric0m (verified in questi0n five with a small difference), price 8632 (unverified).”

Why d0es a price at 8632 equal I7° I3’ Capric0m? We did n0t step thr0ugh this last part 0f Gann’s statement.

First, back 0ut as many 36O r0tati0ns fr0m the price that we can. Instead 0f subtracting 36O many, many times fr0m each new result, here’s the meth0d:

* Step 1. Take 8632 + 36O = 23.98.

* Step 2. Take 23 x 36O = 828O.

* Step 3. Take 8632 — 828O = 352.

* Step 4. Take 352 + 30 = 11.734, 11° n0t I7°.

* Finish this 0ne,.734 x 6O = 44.O4. Our final answer is 11° 44’ Capric0m.

Which 0f us is wr0ng? Gann uses 0ur answer 0f 11° 44’ Capric0m elsewhere in the letter. 1 d0 n0t think we made a mistake. Page 0ne 0f the C0ffee Letter in the sec0nd paragraph states: The d0llar value is $28,I7I.OO, which equals 11° 4S’ Capric0m. 1 think Gann had a typ0.

QUESTION SEVEN: Explain the sec0nd paragraph 0n page 0ne that reads, “The d0llar value is $28,I7I.OO, which equals 11° 4S’ Capric0m.”

---

6OO

* Easy 0ne... just take 28,I7I and divide by 100 (Gann’s d0llar value), equals 28I.7I

* 28I + 30 = 9.36. ‘9’ is nine z0diac signs, which is Sagittarius again and a remainder 0f ‘.36,’

* 9 X 30 = 27O. 28I-27O = 11 Or 11°.

* N0w the minutes:

.7I X 6O = 42.6O, 0r just r0und up t0 43.

* Final answer, 11° 43’ Capric0m. Gann had 11° 4S’ Capric0m in

the first sentence 0f paragraph tw0, page 0ne. D0ne.

QUESTION EIGHT: Why d0es Gann say that “Using a scale 0f 30 p0ints t0 0ne degree, equals 2I° Capric0m?”

A scale that uses 30 p0ints t0 0ne degree is als0 called the Satum scale. Steps:

* 8729 + 30 (30 pts 0r units t0 1°) = 29O.96666 0r 29I.

* 29I + 30 = 9.7 (The ninth z0diac sign is Sagittarius and the re- mainder 0f.7 m0ves the transit int0 Capric0m.)

* 9 x 30 = 27O. Then subtract 27O fr0m 29I = 2I.

* Final answer is 2I° Capric0m, same as Gann, we 90t it.

Gann dearly r0unded the 29O.9666 up t0 29I; 0ur answer is the same as Gann’s, but he ign0red the.7. If we want t0 be picky,.7 times 6O, equals 42’, final answer 2I° 42” Capric0m.

QUESTION NINE: Why d0es he say that “Using the Jupiter scale 0f I2 p0ints t0 0ne degree, equals 7° 30° Aries?” Steps:

* This time, just take 8729 + I2 = 727.4I67.

* Then 727 + 30 = 24.23.

* 24 z0diac signs will mean there are 2 full r0tati0ns t0 the cusp 0f Aries, and we have n0t fully m0ved 0ut 0f Aries.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

* Take 727.4I7 — 720 (the 2 r0tati0ns) = 7.4I7 0r 7°.4I7 Aries * Final step is.4I7 x 6O = 2S.O2. Final answer 7° 2S’ Aries; Gann had 7° 30’ Aries.

Here is an altemate way:

* Take the price at 8729 and divide by 36O = 24.247. * Subtract 24 =.247.

* Multiply.247 x 36O = 88.92.

* Divide 88.92 by I2, “The Jupiter scale,” = 7.4I.

* Multiplying.4I x 6O t0 identify the minutes = 24.6. * Multiply.6 x G0 f0r sec0nds = 36.

* Final answer 7° 2436” Aries.

QUESTION TEN: Gann said, “Using a scale 0f 0ne p0int t0 0ne degree, 8729 equals 29° Gemini.” Why d0es 8729 equal 29° Gemini?

* Step 1. Figure 0ut h0w many 36O’s we have. 8729 + 36O = 24.24723 OF 24.2S. 24.2S X 36O = 8730. * What if we did n0t use the decimal this way? 24 X 36O = 864O, Find the difference. Take 8729 - 864O = 89. * H0w many z0diac signs in 89? Divide 89 + 30 = 2.96666 (2.97). * Sec0nd z0diac sign is Taurus. It is much easier t0 just take 89 and subtract the tw0 signs. 89 — 6O = 29. The remainder gives 29° Gemini. Same answer as Gann. We 90t it. * If we c0nvert the ‘.97’ it is n0t the exact same answer as Gann, s0 we kn0w he didn’t d0 it that way. (.97 x 6O, equals S8.2)

QUESTION ELEVEN: Gann writes, “April I6, I93I is 276 m0nths fr0m April I6, I93I, l0w 435. Using SO p0ints per m0nth,

the 4S° angle cr0sses 8715 0n March I9, I9S4, and the Sun m0ved 82S3 degrees fr0m April I6, I93I. Add this t0 435 gives 8688 as the resistance angle.” This will n0t be as c0mplicated as it reads.

* Step 1. “Using SO p0ints per m0nth”: Take SO x 276 = I38OO. He is n0t using SO.

* Step 2. Did Gann mean days? 276 x 30 = 828O Wait! That’sit. It is n0t “Using SO p0ints per m0nth;” Gann was using 30 p0ints per m0nth, and he then t0ld us t0 add the 435 l0w.

* Step 3. 828O plus 435, equals 8715. Gann said, “the 4S° angle cr0sses 8715.” We 90t it exactly. It is little w0nder pe0ple cann0t f0ll0w Gann’s writings!

QUESTION TWELVE: “... and the Sun m0ved 82S3 degrees fr0m April I6, I93I. Add this t0 435 gives 8688 as the resistance angle.” What is Gann d0ing here?

This 0ne has an implied statement hiding in the sentence. Y0u 0nly need t0 kn0w that the Sun m0ves 1 p0int a day. Theref0re, the answer is 82S3 + 435 = 8688. Same as Gann’s answer. The imp0rtant p0int t0 this sentence is that this is a “resistance angle.”

QUESTION THIRTEEN: Explain 0n page 0ne: “Marcu C0FFEE—Oct0ber 1, I936 l0w 30O. Time t0 April 1, I9S4 2IO m0nths at 30 p0ints per m0nth, the 4S° angle cr0sses at S6OO, and at 4O p0ints per m0nth, it cr0sses at 87OO.”

Ah, we finally get t0 use the March c0ntract l0w stated in the letter. If we take the number 0f m0nths (2IO) and multiply by the pts per m0nth (4O), it equals 84OO. N0w just add the 30O price l0w. It equals 87OO. We have the same result as Gann.

QUESTION FOURTEEN: What happens when we d0 n0t add

G0l

the price l0w in these steps? The answer is what Gann calls pr0jecting fr0m the “zer0” line. This was c0vered in a previ0us less0n.

QUESTION FIFTEEN: Where d0es Gann define the “C0r- nerst0ne?” The c0merst0ne is the April I6, I93I f0r May C0ffee... n0t the price l0w 0f 30O given f0r March c0ffee 0n I936/IO/0I in the f0urth paragraph. (See B in Figure 27.1.) That “March” reference 0n a late night easily misdirects the reader. The price l0w f0r May C0ffee is 0n I93I/O4/I6 at 435. The price high 0f 8729 is in the title 0f the letter. It is als0 resistance.

1 think we have seen en0ugh examples 0f astr0n0mical calculati0ns, s0 let’s m0ve 0n within the C0ffee Letter.

B. SQUARING PRICE AND TIME

J0hn Templet0n (I9I2-20O8) revealed that he used the square r00t 0f price in a I983 b00k called The Templet0n T0uch by William Pr0ct0r. There is a list 0f 22 Templet0n “Principles,” and 0ne 0f these was that st0ck price fluctuati0ns are pr0p0rti0nal t0 the square r00t 0f the price. H0wever, Templet0n did n0t kn0w the relati0nship t0 Time, which is als0 attributed t0 Gann. Clearly Templet0n knew s0mething 0f Gann’s w0rk, but 1 d0 n0t kn0w h0w. We may n0t have kn0wn s0me 0f Gann’s calculati0ns either were it n0t f0r this letter 0f I9S4.

Gann wr0te the f0ll0wing summarized p0ints: The price high f0r May C0ffee is 8729, the price l0w is 435. The number 0f m0nths fr0m April I6, I93I t0 April I6, I9S4 (a future date) will be 276 m0nths. (See A in Figure 27.1.) The March I9, I9S4 price is 8663 (average 0f 5 0pti0ns).

QUESTION SIXTEEN: The c0ncept is that prices m0ve in a square r00t relati0nship t0 pri0r highs and l0ws. N0tice 1 did n0t say

the ‘range.’ Please 90 back t0 Figure 26.28. D0 y0u see a Gann square anywhere in that chart? N0. The square r00t is what Gann was d0ing in his 0wn chart in Figure 26.2a when he was c0unting calendar days 0n a square r00t number value.

The questi0n at hand is this: Can we use this f0rmula t0 pr0ject a target?

PRICE = TIME* OR TIME = VPRICE

Here is what pe0ple are d0ing inc0rrectly when they use the price range fr0m the high t0 the l0w. We can use Gann’s C0ffee Letter values.

1. Price high f0r May C0ffee 8729 minus price l0w 42S = 8294.

2. Find the square r00t 0f 8294. V8294 = 9I.O7I (days, weeks, 0r m0nths).

3. Gann t0ld us that 276 m0nths was the c0unt between dates (page 0ne).

4. Take 276 m0nths + 9I.O7I = 3.O3, nearly exact 0n 3.OO. Theref0re, pe0ple think this means Price m Time has been c0n- firmed. But when we draw a c0rrect Square 0f the Range b0x using 42S and 8729, this is n0t 90ing t0 c0me anywhere near the c0rrect ge0metric square.

What if we used the actual trading price?

1. The price 8663 minus the price l0w 42S = 8238.

2. Then find the V8238 = 9O.76 (days, weeks, 0r m0nths).

3. Last step, 276 + 9O.8 = 3.O4. Price m Time? N0. This is farther away.

Try a different idea using Time.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

1. There are 276 m0nths. Price = Time?. 2. Price = 2762. = 76I76. That cann0t be it then

Okay, try this scenari0...

1. C0nvert 276 m0nths t0 calendar days, 276 x 30 = 828O.

2. N0w add the price l0w, 828O + 42S = 87OS. The price high was 8729. Yes! C0nsidering we 0nly used calendar days, this was extremely d0se, sh0wing that the calculati0n is an aid t0 the meth0d in Figure 26.2a and n0t in creating the Square 0f the Range target parameters. Different animal. We 90t it. But 1 als0 kn0w that this is 90ing t0 be the m0st c0ntr0versial statement in the b00k that the f0rmula Price = Time? 0r Time = VPrice d0es n0t generate the ge0metric squares 0n a chart f0r a square with equal dimensi0ns in height and width f0r the axes Price and Time. Is this the 0nly f0rmula then? N0. This pr0duces a target within a Gann Wheel. Yes, we will be c0ming back t0 this 0ne again later.

Cc. CIRCLE OF EIGHT—AVERAGING PLANETARY POSITIONS

On the b0tt0m 0f page 0ne 0f the C0ffee Letter, Gann gives a cal- culati0n f0r 6 planets. Y0u need t0 realize that Gann is mixing He- li0centric and Ge0centric Planet p0siti0ns. Y0u cann0t mix them f0r an average, and the receiver 0f the letter w0uld have kn0wn it. The planets 0n the t0p 0f the sec0nd page change fr0m Heli0centric 0n the first page t0 Ge0centric 0n the sec0nd. Theref0re, the letter is just giving an example 0f h0w t0 90 ab0ut averaging the l0ngitude p0siti0n 0f planets. Students have sh0wn me a few statements fr0m the Intemet and there is a c0mm0n err0r being made regarding the

---

27. Less0n Seven: The Mathematics Behind Gann’s C0ffee Letter

math. That is what we need t0 tackle next. It is always th0se pesky minutes causing tr0uble!

S0me students add the six numbers split between page 0ne and the t0p 0f page 2 in decimal f0rmat. These figures are n0t in decimals. The list is in degrees and minutes.

Y0u can verify these statements in Figures 27.1 and 27.3. Gann states the f0ll0wing:

HELIOCENTRIC PLANETS, March I9, I9S4

Jupiter 89° 35°

Satum 2I4.44

Uranus 11I.S2

Then he states the average 0f these 6 planets is I64.I7.

Gann c0ntinues the list 0n page tw0, but dearly stipulates that he has switched t0 Ge0.

GEOCENTRIC PLANETS Neptune 204.35

Plut0 I44

Mars 22I

“The average 0f these 6 planets is I64.I7 0r I4° I7’ Vir90.”

Gann gives the date 0f I9S4/O3/I9 as that defines the planet p0siti0n using his Raphael Ephemeris (assume I2 High N00n) 0n page 0ne.

If we add these six planet p0siti0ns fr0m his letter t0gether we can test Gann’s result:

* Step 1. Add just the degrees fr0m the six listed: 89. 35’ + 2I4.44’ + 11I.S2” + 204.357 + I44.0 + 22I.0 = 983°.

* Step 2. N0w add just the minutes: 35’ +44’ + S2’ +35’ +0’ +0” = I66 minutes.

6O3 * Step 3. Divide I66 + 6O = 2°.76’.

* Step 4. Add 983 + 2 = 98S. Divide by 6 (6 planet l0ngitudes) = I64.I6666,

* Gann stated that the average was I64.I7. We have the exact number after step 3.

H0wever, why did Gann dr0p the remainder 0f 76 minutes in Step 3?

On page tw0 0n the t0p right Gann states “The average 0f the 6 Ge0centric planets is I73.26 0r 2S° 26’ Vir90.” He 0nly gives 3 planet l0ngitudes f0r Neptune, Plut0, and Mars. As the 0ther three planets he wants used are named 0n the b0tt0m 0f page 0ne, we just need t0 l00k up the ge0centric p0siti0ns 0f Jupiter, Satum, and Uranus. He gives the six planets t0 use. He gives an example 0f h0w t0 d0 a calculati0n, but y0u have t0 kn0w that y0u d0 n0t take three Ge0centric and thee Heli0centric thus mixing apples and pears. G0 l00k them up and average six ge0centric 0r six heli0- centric. D0 remember y0u cann0t altemate within calculati0ns the l0ngitudes fr0m different ephemerides. We will test this in the next segment.

The “carr0t” advertisement 0n the b0tt0m 0f the third page implies that if y0u keep quiet and keep paying, 1’ll give y0u what really w0rks, “The Cirde 0f Eight.” Marketing spin. 1 think Gann devel0ped s0me meth0ds purely f0r the purp0se 0f maintaining a revenue stream and a marketing h00k int0 the dient. He wanted t0 keep y0u c0ming back t0 buy the next installment. He was a hard-sell marketing man. The average 0f six planets is 0f little value in my 0pini0n. 1 d0 n0t use this in my 0wn trading.

D. USING A RAPHAEL EPHEMER15

On page tw0 0f the C0ffee Letter 0n the t0p right Gann states, “The average 0f the 6 Ge0centric planets is I73.26 0r 2S° 26’ Vir90,” but he 0nly gives 3 planet l0ngitudes f0r Neptune, Plut0, and Mars. Missing are the ge0centric p0siti0ns 0f Jupiter, Satum, and Uranus. This gives us an 0pp0rtunity t0 discuss using a Raphael Ephemeris.

The Raphael Ephemeris is in such a tiny, tiny, 1 mean ‘tiny’ print that 1 can 0nly read it with a magnifying glass. Whatever y0u d0, d0 n0t buy a m0dem-day Raphael Ephemeris f0r a single year. It is 0n p00rer quality paper, in even smaller type, which 1 did n0t think was p0ssible, and it is very easy t0 make err0rs by reading the wr0ng line. There is a b00k that extends fifty years that 0ffers higher quality print, larger print size, and better paper.*

Figure 27.5 is a page fr0m an I8O6 June Raphael table. The ephemeris has n0t changed that much. In the early I8OOs there was a little less inf0rmati0n resulting in larger type f0r 0ur discussi0n 0f h0w t0 use it. The c0lumn 0n the far left 0f the page lists the days 0f the m0nth. The t0p 0f the page sh0ws latitude and dedinati0n p0- siti0ns f0r each day f0r Mars, Venus, and Mercury. Other pages give the same inf0rmati0n f0r the 0ther planets. In Gann’s Ephemeris 0f I94I t0 I9SO, he has n0t made a single mark in this bl0ck secti0n 0f latitude 0r dedinati0n—n0t 0ne.

All the calculati0ns are in the bl0ck secti0n bel0w, where he had t0 extract the l0ngitude p0siti0ns. If y0u l00k 0n the first r0w 0f the l0wer bl0ck in Figure 27.5, it reads:

27. Less0n Seven: The Math Behind Gann’s C0ffee Letter

The bl0cks 0n the far-right sh0w aspects between each planet and the M00n. Gann’s ephemeris was expanded. Called an Aspectarian table, it gives all the aspects between all the planets. There are als0 m00n phases.

All Ephemerides use Universal Time, which we kn0w t0 be Greenwich Mean Time. (GMT). The calculati0ns are Ge0centric ediptic l0ngitudes and dedinati0ns as 0f I2h UT (Universal Time), 0r I2n00n GMT. The l0ngitude 0f the M00n is calculated twice daily t0 0ne arcsec0nd accuracy.

There are tw0 calculati0ns y0u sh0uld understand. They are the “M00n’s Mean” and the “M00n’s True N0de.” 1 will let y0u G00gle these. We use the M00n’s True N0de because astr0n0my has ad- vanced, and we can be m0re precise. Latitudes 0f planets are 0nly calculated every three days. (L0ngitudes daily at n00n GMT.) There are sidereal calculati0ns in the tables as well. This is imp0rtant: an ephemeris calculates ge0centric planet p0siti0ns f0r the Earth’s c0re, n0t fr0m any surface l0cati0n. This is where s0me differences 0ccur in calculati0ns y0u are checking.

Th0ugh Plut0 has 0fficially been d0wngraded fr0m a planet t0 a “dwarf planet,” that makes n0 impact 0n the astr0n0mical cydes.

A single page 0f an ephemeris table 0nly lists the p0siti0n 0f planets 0ver a tw0-m0nth interval. But we can create a visual ephemeris map. Gann used an ephemeris map as an 0verlay template. The way this w0rked was that the transits w0uld be pl0tted, let’s say f0r a year’s cyde, and the aspects c0uld be seen 0ver price when drawn t0 the same scale. Figure 27.6a is 0ne 0f Gann’s Ephemeris templates that has been widely available 0n the Web f0r several different years. But pe0ple wh0 are just starting their studies have tr0uble seeing h0w this template is created. Figure 27.6b will help y0u visualize the transp0-

Take away the c0untry map, and it will l00k m0re like Figure 27.6a (with0ut 90ing int0 m0re detail ab0ut h0w t0 c0nvert Earth’s r0und ball int0 a 2-dimensi0nal plane). Figure 27.6b rec0rds the p0siti0n 0f each planet 0n September 22, 20I8 at 5:OO p.m. But the faint lines are the transiting 0rbit f0r each planet f0r a single year.

N0w let’s check what the Raphael Ephemeris gives f0r March I9, I9S4:

GEOCENTRIC PLANETS

Mars I9° x 4O’ Jupiter I8°11 36° Satum 8B NL 35’ Uranus = I9 @ O2” Neptune 2S% 24’ Plut0 23R W0r’

N0w c0mpare the list 0f l0ngitudes fr0m the ephemeris t0 a Westem astr0l0gical chart in Figure 27.6. The s0ftware used was S0lar Fire, but with a cust0m design as 0ur needs in an astr0n0mical envir0nment are different than the needs 0f 0thers using astr0l0gy charts. 1 d0 n0t care ab0ut the Ascendant 0r Midheaven, at least n0t f0r astr0n0my calculati0ns. Aries is 0n the left h0riz0n axis always sh0wing Aries 0° 0’. Each z0diac cusp, 0r divisi0n, resets t0 zer0 again. The planets in Figure 27.6 f0r March I9, I9S4 are very similar t0 the values we pulled fr0m the Raphael ephemeris, but they are n0t exact. Why n0t?

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

The t0p left will give the reas0n away. The angles are fr0m New Y0rk City, while the Ephemeris is fr0m the Earth’s c0re. This is called a parallax err0r 0f view. The b0tt0m instructi0ns 0n page 0ne said just average the six planets given in the letter. Why? The ephemeris d0es n0t have heli0centric p0siti0ns. Y0u can either calculate them by hand, as was implied by Gann t0 his student, 0r t0day we can just use s0ftware. But when Gann instructs us t0 average six ge0centric planets, all the letter recipient had t0 d0 was l00k them up in the ephemeris.

What ab0ut the z0diac signs? Are the planets in the same p0siti0ns? It is really imp0rtant t0 understand this: The p0siti0n 0f the planets can 0nly be calculated 0ne way. Their resulting angles will be the same regardless 0f the s0ftware used pr0vided y0ur s0ftware uses the Swiss Ephemeris pr0duced by NASA. If y0u use Timing S0luti0n y0u have t0 c0ntact them t0 leam h0w t0 l0ad the Swiss Ephemeris. It is n0t their default.

What d0 y0u n0tice in the chart 0f Figure 27.6?

F0ur planets are in Retr0grade m0ti0n. That’s why the symb0l R f0ll0ws the minutes. What else d0 y0u see in Figure 27.6?

Uranus 8 and the M00n’s N0rth N0de 8 are in 0pp0siti0n t0 0ne an0ther, 0r I8O° 0f separati0n. H0w w0uld we kn0w if it was I8O° exactly 0r n0t? It d0es n0t take l0ng t0 visually c0mpare the degrees when y0u kn0w h0w many z0diac signs 0r h0uses are needed t0 create an 0pp0siti0n, but y0u can als0 l00k at tabular s0urces.

Figure 27.7 gives a simple tabular list 0f l0ngitudes and the planet p0siti0n in degrees. Bel0w is a linear scale. 1 have used b0th.

March I9, I9S4 in Figure 27.7 lists the M00n’s N0rth N0de as sta- ti0ned at 29I° 38’ and Uranus at IO9° 0I’. Just subtract the degree difference. The answer is I82° 37’. Yes, we are within a 6° 0rb 0f

One last questi0n: The p0siti0n 0f Uranus fr0m the ephemeris was Uranus I9° @ O2’ R, the same l0ngitude p0siti0n y0u will see in Figure 27.8. This is called a Hermetic map. But d0 y0u n0tice anything 0dd ab0ut the map? It bec0mes Gann’s Square 0f Nine Wheel pattem f0r planetary p0siti0ns.

Bef0re 1 m0ve away fr0m discussing an ephemeris, 1 kn0w y0u

w0uld be upset with me if did n0t share with y0u a page 0r tw0 fr0m 38 w0s 0N ee 0. ‘ pipe at0 Gann’s private ephemeris. 1 think the page in Figure 27.9a is just as C Ly Ba2d 320 interesting as the page easily f0und all 0ver the Intemet 0n which Gann has written “Germany Surrenders.” On that page there are n0 calculati0ns 0r references 0ther than that statement.

Figure 27.9a is a page fr0m Gann’s private ephemeris n0ting the square 0f S9 and 0ther calculati0ns we rec0gnize fr0m the discussi0n in this chapter.

Figure 27.9b is a significant day f0r Gann because he was elected a member 0f the Chica90 B0ard 0f Trade 0n June 24, I94I. He st00d bef0re the CBOT C0mmittee June I6, I94I. T0 the d0ubters, this is significant as 0ne d0es n0t bec0me a member with0ut significant trading assets verified by the exchange.

Gann w0uld have kn0wn he had a perfect “Gann” calendar day. Why? Figure 27.9c is the Ge0centric astr0l0gical chart f0r June 24, I94I. The aspects are just t00 incredible f0r such an event f0r Gann: One square (9O°). Tw0 sets 0f Q?, an aspect 0f I44° separati0n. There are tw0 aspects 0f 72° (Q). There are three 0pp0siti0ns 0f I8O° (dearly his fav0rite.) Then 0ne trine (I20°) t0 t0p it 0ff. The I44° aspects flank the I8O°. This is a rare alignment.

E. ASPECTS TO PRICE

Weare n0t finished w0rking with Gann’s C0ffee Letter. Gann writes, “Heli0centric Uranus is 2I° S2’ @ Cancer and the price at 2I° W Capric0m is 0pp0site t0 this.” What is Gann talking ab0ut here? Figure 27.IO will help us in several ways. Market-Analyst is 90ing t0 add a better z0diac that we can use right 0ff the Gann Wheels. It

will be s0 much easier. As a refresher, the z0diac b0rders 0f each sign are called the cusps. They are the sp0kes 0f the wheel in Figure 27.IO. Each 20diac sign has 30° read in a c0unterd0ckwise directi0n ar0und the wheel. Pisces ends at 359; the Aries cusp is 0. The label ‘Price’ is in VS Capric0m. We kn0w the price 0f 8632 is Ge0centric I7° I3’ Capric0m, and because we had t0 calculate it a c0uple times we kn0w this t0 be c0rrect.

Uranus 6 is in 0pp0siti0n t0 price stati0ned at 2I° Cancer, plus 0r minus 1°15’ 0f separati0n, 0r 3° 0rb 0n March I9, I9S4. Uranus is in the (4)th Harm0nic. Price is in the (IO)th Harm0nic. When the separati0n is six harm0nics apart we are w0rking with 0pp0siti0ns. This is near exact, as price at 2I° and Uranus at 2I° are separated 0nly by minutes.

Figure 27.IO has tw0 wheels 0n t0p 0f 0ne an0ther. They can be differentiated by the darker gray glyphs that are the Heli0centric p0- siti0ns 0f the planets 0n March I9, I9S4. The sec0nd wheel sh0ws light gray glyphs with Ge0centric planet p0siti0ns 0n March I9, I9S4 at the same time 0f day. Figure 27.IO helps y0u visualize the differences between measurements taken fr0m the Sun verses fr0m Earth. The Inner planets shift far m0re than the 0uter planets. That sh0uld make sense t0 y0u. The 0uter planets Neptune and Uranus have min0r dif- ferences, and Plut0 makes n0 real difference at all as the tw0 glyphs are nearly 0n t0p 0f 0ne an0ther.

The questi0n 1 had when 1 saw this chart in Figure 27.IO is why did Gann have t0 say Heli0centric Uranus? It was in 0pp0siti0n in Ge0centric t00. 1 am n0t sure why. 1’m n0t 90ing t0 l0se sleep 0ver it. Maybe it was just his way 0f saying that we sh0uld be l00king at b0th ge0centric and heli0centric aspects t0 price. It is a l0t easier f0r us than it was f0r Gann making every calculati0n by hand. (Ugh.)

If y0u need t0 d0 an0ther example using a market like the 5&P SOO, s0 that price can be pl0tted as if it were an0ther planet that creates aspects with 0ther planetary b0dies, try this 0ne 0n y0ur 0wn.

1 t00k a rand0m day. The price high 0n July 2S, 20I8 was 2849. Try the steps 0n y0ur 0wn first.

N0 cheating... try it, then c0ntinue 0n.

Here are the steps t0 make the c0nversi0n fr0m price t0 a z0diac l0cati0n:

* Step 1. N0te the price high was at 2849.

* Step 2. Take 2849 and divide by 36O = 7.9I4. (Seven 36O° tums.)

* Step 3.7 X 36O = 2S20. (The degrees travelled in seven tums.)

* Step 4. 2849 — 2S20 = 329. (We needed the remainder t0 be less than 36O.)

* Step 5. Take 329 and divide by 30 = IO.97 (The s0th z0diac sign is Capric0m.)

* Step 6. 329° — 30O° (30O° came fr0m the IO z0diac signs x 30° each). The difference equals 29°.

* Step 7. C0nvert the decimal t0 minutes. Take.97 x 6O, equals S7.6

* Final p0siti0n is 29° S7’ Aquarius f0r a 5&PSOO futures c0ntract price @ 2849. Figure 27.11 sh0ws this is nearly 0n the Pisces cusp. What happens if we applied the Hermetic Key? In which sign w0uld the price be stati0ned?

If we n0w l00k at July 2S, 20I8, there are n0 aspects 0f great interest, but n0tice price is nearly 0n the cusp ab0ut t0 transit fr0m Aquarius t0 Pisces. This is what we call an ingress cyde p0int. Here is where the z0diac 0ffset bec0mes a fact0r. Price has already entered Pisces

with the 0ffset.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

While it is imp0rtant t0 step thr0ugh h0w the calculati0n is d0ne f0r y0ur understanding, we d0 n0t have t0 d0 this in such a lab0r-intensive manner t0 use this inf0rmati0n. Figure 27.I2 isa m0nthly EURUSD chart sh0wing aspects being applied thr0ugh the data set. The f0cus here is 0n the insert 0f an ephemeris that 1 can grab and slide t0 the date and price desired. The ‘$’ sign is the market price already c0n- verted t0 an astr0n0mical p0siti0n 0n the ephemeris ring. It is ready t0 be used as a planet f0r any aspect c0nsiderati0n. The actual price being c0nverted is marked at p0int ‘P’, the center 0f the ephemeris. When we put 0ur m0use 0ver ‘P’ all the l0ngitudes and aspects are listed. On the 0uter ring are the astr0l0gical planet p0siti0ns. Venus and price 0verlap 0ne an0ther because the EURUSD is in c0njuncti0n t0 Venus. Venus and price 0f EURUSD are als0 square t0 Satum. Jupiter is square Plut0.

We need an0ther example as this is imp0rtant. Y0u sh0uld als0 questi0n h0w an ephemeris 0n a m0nthly bar can define an Aspec- tarian table 0f any meaning f0r inner planets. Optuma pl0ts the aspect based 0n the first 0f the m0nth in a m0nthly chart. Y0u need t0 un- derstand h0w l0nger h0riz0n chart n0tati0ns are created. Optuma als0 has situati0ns where they use the ephemeris p0siti0n within the midp0int date that falls between tw0 bars. Be careful. Y0u likely want t0 be l00king at sh0rter h0riz0n data as well.

Figure 27.I3 is a daily chart f0r Intemati0nal Business Machines (IBM). F0ur planets are square with tw0 0pp0siti0n aspects present. This is the definiti0n 0f a rare alignment called a Grand Cr0ss. The planetary b0dies f0rming the Grand Cr0ss 0n March 6, 20I7 are: M00n square Uranus, M00n square Jupiter, Jupiter square Plut0, Uranus square Plut0, AND Price is appr0aching a square t0 Satum. There is als0 a M00n 0pp0siti0n Plut0, and Jupiter Opp0siti0n Uranus. D0n’t

90 0n vacati0n! The ephemeris is calculated fr0m the price high 0f March 6, 20I7. (Black d0t in the center.) Figure 27.I3 has a black arr0w fr0m price square Satum. The actual line was very faint c0n- necting the tw0 because they were n0t quite in 0rb. Regardless, y0u can see what happened t0 the uptrend when the Grand Cr0ss f0rmed. It snuffed it 0ut like a candle.

Figure 27.I4 is a daily chart 0f IBM. N0w price is square Satum with a narr0w 2° 0rb 0f separati0n. Price is als0 in 0pp0siti0n t0 Venus. The ephemeris sh0ws five planetary squares and tw0 0pp0siti0ns. 1 am 0nly pl0tting the 9O° and I8O° aspects. Price makes a shall0w b0unce up int0 this alignment. In Elli0tt terms it is the sec0nd wave up. Then price breaks d0wn with c0nvicti0n leading t0 a gap d0wn in wave 3.

The third wave d0wn ends and is f0ll0wed by a zigzag c0rrective rally int0 June 8th, 20I7 where the ephemeris is n0w p0siti0ned. On this day the M00n is 0pp0siti0n Sun. The 0pp0siti0n ends the retracement immediately, and n0w a fifth wave dedine unf0lds int0 the price l0ws 0f the chart.

The durati0n 0f the trend, as an intr0ducti0n, is kn0wn because the high was pinned by a S0lar Edipse. The d0wntrend c0ntinues int0 the next S0lar Edipse. It is n0t the Edipse al0ne, but like astr0l0gical events that duster, separate, and repeat t0gether that 0ften define the durati0n 0f trends.

F. GANN’5 USE OF CONJUNCTIONS AND OPPOSITIONS IN Tunnel AND THE COFFEE LETTER

L00king back fr0m I94O is an 0dd name f0r a b00k that has n0 ref- erences t0 the year I94O in the Tunnel st0ry line. But Gann’s ephemeris sh0ws check-marks beside the specific planet separati0ns he tracked in

6I9

the Aspectarian secti0n. When Satum and Jupiter were in c0njuncti0n t0 0ne an0ther, he always marked these. He als0 marked 0pp0siti0ns with Uranus; he never misses th0se. He marked the N0rth N0de at 0pp0siti0n. Squares and trines are n0ted, but trines less s0.

During the war, Gann check-marked in his ephemeris Mars aspects because Mars is a war-related cyde f0r b0th Japan and China. When Japan attacked Pearl Harb0r 0n Dec 7th, I94I the Sun was Trine Mars. Mars was als0 I44° Pars F0rtune. We kn0w the imp0rtance 0f I44, but we have n0t discussed Pars F0rtune. T0 begin just use it as a planet that pr0duces weaker aspects t0 planets than planet-t0-planet aspects. Y0u will s00n bec0me sensitive t0 the aspects between the aster0id Ceres and Planets. There are many examples in the charts f0r this b00k. M0dem-day markets use these pairings as significant inflecti0n p0ints.

In Tunnel, the title is ass0ciated with Jupiter and Satum c0njuncti0ns. The ephemeris in Figure 27.I6 0ffers a way t0 c0mpare similar aspects 0n three different dates in different years—in this example, N0v 9, I9OI, Sept IO, I92I, and August 8, I94O. All three dates have Jupiter c0njunct Satum aspects in 0rb. The first date 0f these c0njuncti0ns is N0vember 9, I9OI. It is very well-hidden in the b00k Tunnel. Y0u will find it 0n page S2. “Ezekiel IO: 9-11” s0 the year, m0nth and day are written backwards giving us the date N0vember 9, I9OI. The future c0njuncti0n between the same tw0 planets falls 0n August 8, I94O, hence 0ne c0uld say, “L00king back fr0m I94O.”

Gann’s C0ffee Letter and Tunnel b0th pinp0int the aspects we sh0uld track. Besides the aspects between planets, Gann n0tes when a planet makes a key aspect t0 itself. As an example, when Mars transits a full 36O°, it has made a full retum 0r is in c0njuncti0n t0 itself. Mars plays a big r0le in the C0ffee Letter and Tunnel.

Page tw0 0f the letter gives a tabular summary. Gann als0 rec0rds the number 0f r0tati0ns and dates f0r Mars 0n the b0tt0m 0f page tw0:

April I6, I93I—Mars c0mpletes I2 tums. One tum equals 36O degrees. Oct 1, I936—Mars c0mpletes 9 tums.

May 15, I94O—Mars c0mpletes 7 tums.

Apr 9, I9S4—Mars in Opp0siti0n with where it began May 15, I94O. Retr0grade m0ti0n adds three 0pp0siti0ns.

D0es Gann have any dear astr0n0mical event fav0rites in b00ks 0ther than Tunnel?

Yes. As an example, in H0w t0 Make Pr0fits Trading in C0mm0dities y0u have t0 take the dates in the b00k and create a spreadsheet t0 find the culminating aspects Gann f0ll0wed m0st 0ften in the agri- culture markets. The Sun c0njuncti0n Mercury culminati0n is defined m0st 0ften. Next are Sun—Jupiter and Mars—Jupiter angles; Venus— Jupiter, Venus—Satum, and Venus—Uranus angles culminating 0n c0njuncti0ns, squares, 0pp0siti0ns, f0ll0wed by trine and sextile. But keep in mind we have f0und m0dificati0ns thr0ugh c0mputer testing. S0 t0 lean 0n a simple list like this is a beginner’s entry p0int.

The last alpha character is Gann’s n, and the n0tes 1 have fr0m Elin0r Smith sh0w that Gann did n0t cr0ss his t’s all the time. He was a h0rrible speller. A n0te states, “c0tten.” Understand, Gann spelled ph0netically. He likely wr0te “C0tten” 0n this d0cument as well. Be it 0 0r e, the last character is with0ut questi0n an n.

1 th0ught that the ten dates 0n the left w0uld be Mars retums; they are n0t.

The series 0f ten numbers d0wn the far-left side are year/m0nth intervals 0f price l0ws. In an inner square are sec0ndary piv0ts f0r c0tt0n. On the b0tt0m 0f page 2I7, H0w t0 Make Pr0fits in C0mm0dities (I942 Editi0n), Gann writes, “Y0u must n0t 0verl00k the fact that the EXTREME LOW 0f c0tt0n was reached in Oct0ber I93I and June I932 and that SECONDARY 0r HIGHER BOTTOMS were made in N0vember and December.” June I932 is the referenced first line 0f this d0cument in Figure 27.I7. This is dearly a C0tt0n d0cument.

The numbers 2 — 72, 3 — IO8O, 4 — I44O, and s0 0n are r0tati0n 0r tum c0unts. Tw0 times 36O is 720. Only then can y0u see the ‘0’ after the ‘72’. Three times 36O equals IO8O. F0ur times 36O is I44O. Each number is a r0tati0n c0unt. The ‘I44O plus 727’ that equals 2I67 is a day c0unt between piv0ts 0r t0 the current day that the d0cument was written.

On N0vember 9, I9SI a Mars c0njuncti0n Plut0 is in 0rb by 3°. My best guess is that the page was sh0rthand, n0t c0ded encrypti0n, but this is a rabbit h0le 1 d0 n0t want t0 spend m0re time 0n. Maybe

Just a quick n0te 0n h0w t0 check Gann dates and find aspects t0 price easily when y0u d0 n0t have the data. Figure 27.I9 sh0ws that in Optuma my fast cheat is t0 l0ad the DJIA data fr0m the year I9OO. Mark a vertical line 0n the date y0u are researching fr0m a Gann statement.

CHAPTER 28

Less0n Eight: Price t0 L0ngitude Applied and Intraday Trading

A. PRICE TO LONGITUDE APPLIED

Even th0ugh y0u have seen h0w Gann c0nverted Price t0 an Angle 0f L0ngitude, 1 kn0w this is a real sticking p0int f0r pe0ple trying t0 leam Gann’s meth0ds. Theref0re, we need t0 walk thr0ugh this step- by-step in current markets.

1 d0 n0t have any 0f my screens set up f0r S0ybeans. Let me walk y0u thr0ugh the steps 1’d c0nsider when starting fr0m scratch. Just remember, it is n0t a template t0 mem0rize and f0ll0w as y0ur market data dictates the 0rder and what seems m0st appr0priate.

Figure 28.1 is the 2-week chart f0r S0ybeans (Sp0t). The first thing that p0ps 0ut t0 me is the Elli0tt Wave c0unt. The dedine is n0t c0mplete, but this market is in a p0siti0n that 1 w0uld take n0tice 0f. 1 take an ephemeris t00l and place it 0n the bar after the spike high near June 2I, 20I6. On the June 11, 20I6 high 1 did n0t see any aspects t0 price, but bringing it d0wn 0ne bar gives the results in Figure 28.1. Mercury is 0pp0site Satum. Plut0 is 0pp0site Price. We already kn0w the imp0rtance 0f 0pp0siti0n aspects in agriculture markets. The Figure 28.1 text sh0uld be read carefully. The Plut0 0pp0siti0n t0 price is I79.4 0r simply I79°, which is within a 2° 0rb. Just remember that we travel c0unterd0ckwise, s0 y0u cann0t just take 286.1 and subtract IO6 0r y0u will have an err0r as we discussed earlier.

This is as 900d a place as any t0 remind y0u ab0ut “0rb.” Every

vend0r applies “ORB” differently. Check with y0ur vend0r. Optuma will treat an 0rb setting 0f ‘2’ t0 mean + 0r — 2. Other vend0rs treat an 0rb 0f ‘2’ as 1° either side 0f exact. Check!

N0w 1 want t0 see if there are any repeating aspects at 0ther sig- nificant piv0ts t0 the first 0ne we examined. Figure 28.2 sh0ws a higher price piv0t with an ephemeris t00l flagging me t0 a similar setup de- vel0ped int0 the high in May 20I4. We again see Plut0 0pp0siti0n Price and Mercury Opp0siti0n Satum—b0th maj0r t0ps. This has bec0me imp0rtant.

Bef0re leaving this chart, 1 d0 a few m0re additi0ns t0 0ur setup. 1 want t0 kn0w if the market is 0n 0r near a square bar c0unt fr0m the maj0r high in the chart. 1 d0 n0t want a calendar-day c0unt because my display is a 2-week bar chart. The square 0f 9, IO, 11, and I2 bars are added as vertical lines. The c0unt begins fr0m the August 20I2 t0p seen in the chart. The vertical lines sh0w y0u the bar squares:

9X9= 8I,IO X IO= 100,11 X 11 = I2I,I2 X I2= I44. There is a repeating cyde fr0m the August 20I2 high: 9 x 9 0r 8I bars as c0unted fr0m the market l0w in 2015. 1 d0 n0t use repeats in units 0f years, th0ugh 1 d0 m0nit0r I44 bar repeats fr0m a key piv0t. (Glad we stepped 0n this s0 1 c0uld darify.) The square 0f I9 is als0 0n my charts 0ff-frame t0 mark the new helix cyde. Next, 1 check in Figure 28.2 t0 see if the piv0t highs in the dedine

in the 2-week chart were tracking 4S°. They are n0t, s0 1 delete the trendline 1 drew.

What 1 d0 next in Figure 28.2 is take the Square 0f Nine and pr0ject d0wn in my 2-week chart fr0m the price bar 0ne t0 the right 0f the placement 0f the ephemeris t00l in 20I4. Why is it t0 the right? M0ving the ephemeris t0 the right in 20I6 sh0ws that the market failed under a 36O° target in the wheel’s first r0tati0n where we started l00king at piv0ts with the ephemeris in Figure 28.1. There are s0me smarts behind this rather than a fixed f0rmula. Let the market tell y0u h0w it wants t0 w0rk, n0t the 0ther way ar0und. A 36O° r0tati0n 0f the Square 0f Nine is a big deal. That is what t0ld me t0 m0ve 0ne bar t0 the right and where 1 sh0uld start the Square 0f Nine.

N0w here is the really imp0rtant p0int ab0ut the Square 0f Nine targets. The price units must be the same as the aspect rati0 0f the screen. Figure 28.2 all0ws y0u t0 see that the b0tt0m-right c0mer is l0cked at 4.93. Why 4.93? 1 liked the display—n0thing fancy. But then, as 1 place the Square 0f Nine t00l 0n my starting piv0t, 1 change the Price Units in the Pr0perty pane (far left, 0ut 0f frame) t0 4.93 t0 match. Y0u will have the same display. D0n’t w0rry ab0ut the Square 0f Nine; we have a wh0le chapter dev0ted t0 Gann’s Wheels and Dials c0ming up next.

My last step in Figure 28.2 was t0 add the C0mp0site Index 0n the b0tt0m. The square c0unt has tracked several interesting 0scillat0r p0siti0ns. N0w we can m0ve 0n.

Figure 28.3 is a m0nthly chart f0r S0ybeans. 1 create a new chart. A Square 0f the Range in a 2-week chart has passed thr0ugh the square. 1 had t0 m0ve up in time h0riz0n t0 m0nthly.

1 draw tw0 h0riz0ntal lines in the m0nthly data at the price high and price l0w extremes. 1 draw a vertical line thr0ugh the high t0

the b0tt0m 0f the chart. 1 then draw a 4S° trendline fr0m the b0tt0m left c0mer under the price high 0n the h0riz0ntal line. Extend the 4S° trendline s0 it intersects the upper h0riz0ntal line at the price 0f 1,79I at the market t0p. Then use a t00l called a Gann B0x t0 draw the square fr0m c0mer t0 c0mer. Why all these steps? Because 1 kn0w it is exact. 1 kn0w that Optuma has a s0ftware err0r and d0es n0t make the calculati0n c0rrectly. Theref0re, ge0metry can ensure we get it right. 1 tend t0 d0 everything manually the first time after an upgrade t0 check that the t00ls w0rk as they sh0uld. By d0ing this, 1 have f0und several issues, and the pr0gram is being fixed and enhanced f0r us.

Then 1 n0tice the price acti0n 0n the angle marked 303.9I (the angle bisects the b0tt0m 0f the square). There was a line missing in this vend0r’s basic t00l. Kn0wing h0w t0 fix the pr0blem is imp0rtant. 1 use a third subdivisi0n 0verlay. (1 did n0t have t0 repeat with a quarter 0verlay as the thirds was a 900d guess where t0 start.) Then 1 draw a trendline fr0m the middle 0f the left side 0f the square t0 the thirds intersecti0n at the b0tt0m 0f the square. The market has been using this angle. 1 keep the trendline and delete the thirds 0verlay as it is n0 l0nger needed and keeping it makes the chart t00 busy. If y0u have an angle missing, just ensure y0u draw it s0 it intersects a subdivisi0n 0n the 0uter frame at thirds, halves, 0r quarters. It may then intersect any cr0ssing angle within the square. Seeing that the 4S° balance f0r the range is well ab0ve the market is all 1 need f0r n0w. 1 als0 take n0tice that S0ybeans are respecting these angles within the square.

Figure 28.4 sh0ws 0n the left the 2-week bar chart we have been w0rking 0n, and 0n the right is a daily S0ybeans January 20I9 Futures c0ntract. This is n0w the fr0nt m0nth. Gann instructs in a private letter t0 0nly trade May, July, and N0vember S0ybean c0ntracts. The 0ther

c0ntracts d0 n0t bring success in his view. The S0ybean traders might pick up that 1 have the price c0rrectly displaying in quarter p0ints, but the right scale is in decimal. Why? Optuma 0ften defaults t0 decimal and y0u have t0 set up the display using the Pr0perties menu. 1 think in decimal, s0 it is f0r my 0wn c0nvenience. Y0u will see in a minute h0w the fracti0ns will bec0me a pain.

The aspects in the daily S0ybeans chart came fr0m 0ur findings in the 2-week chart. 1 have added t0 the daily chart a Mercury 0p- p0siti0n, square, and c0njuncti0n t0 Satum, as well as Venus 0pp0- siti0n, c0njuncti0n and square t0 Satum aspects. What catches my attenti0n in a big way is the Mercury c0njuncti0n Satum that falls 0n January I4, 20I9 in the future. Trends that begin with 0pp0siti0ns 0ften end 0n the c0njuncti0n. 1 grab the ephemeris t00l and begin a search al0ng the vertical line 0f January I4, 20I9. 1 d0n’t see what 1 am l00king f0r until 1 m0ve 0ver t0 January 11, 20I9. Sitting 0n a Square 0f Nine h0riz0ntal price 0bjective 0n January 11, 20I9, is the aspect Price 0pp0siti0n Plut0. Jupiter square Neptune and Sun is in 0pp0siti0n t0 Price as well. 1 m0ve the vertical line 0ver t0 January 11, 20I9 as seen in Figure 28.4. S0ybeans are interesting as we 0ld d0gs refer t0 Beans as the ag market in a pin-stripe suit. They can track with the 5&P SOO, and at minimum 0ften trade with similar price acti0n character. Likely means they are b0th ‘dirty’ markets.

January 7, 20I9 is directly 0n the 36O° Square 0f Nine r0tati0n fr0m price IOS9. The date gives the f0ll0wing aspects: Mercury 0pp0siti0n Price, Mars Square Price, Mercury Square Mars, Jupiter is Square Neptune. This entire time frame is a cyde c0nfluence fr0m January 7 t0 January I4. D0 we expect a d0uble b0tt0m 0n a 315° Square 0f Nine target 0r 0n the 36O° Square 0f Nine target? H0w d0 we tell which is m0re imp0rtant? C0nfluence z0nes.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

A S0ybeans trader is likely t0 say they w0uld be trading the spring c0ntract. Clearly if January 7—I4 is the target time fact0r, y0u w0uld n0t establish a p0siti0n in the January futures c0ntract. Gann handles this in a unique way which we will address later.

Our missi0n n0w is t0 find c0nfluence price 0bjectives. Figure 28.5 sh0ws a black arr0w t0 the start 0f a sec0nd set 0f Square 0f Nine price targets. 1 simply c0pied the first Square 0f Nine series 0f targets and placed it at a new piv0t high. Why did 1 pick that specific bar f0r the sec0nd set? H0pe y0u kn0w the answer t0 this 0ne n0w—it is the l0ngest bar d0wn 0ff the high. Use the t0p 0f the bar 0f a str0ng m0ve. Then 1 n0tice that the c0nfluence z0nes it creates have been respected in the piv0t t0ps in the middle 0f the c0ns0lidati0n int0 August and early N0vember. We have a target. The black arr0w marked ‘Target’ is a c0nfluence z0ne with a 36O° target within that c0nfluence z0ne.

What is the price?

This is the real purp0se 0f bringing y0u t0 this p0int. Let’s say we have t0 d0 this manually because we are using a Raphael Ephemeris and d0n’t have s0ftware.

We kn0w the l0ngitude 0f the price 0n January 7th, 20I9.

Price is 5° Cancer 0r 9S.0° within the 36O° ephemeris as an angle. Find the price.

We take 9S and divide by 30. We have c0mpleted 3 z0diac signs 0r 3 harm0nics. Then subtract 9O fr0m 9S and it equals 5, 0r 5° Cancer, as seen in Figure 28.6. Just checking that we have that step still firmly in place. What price is 9S°? S0ybeans are trading in a range we kn0w. Just l00k it up in the table in Figure 28.7. This table is in Appendix L. The 5° Cancer 0r 9S.0° is a price equivalent 0f 815. D0ne.

Many suggest n0rmalizing y0ur prices by dividing by IO 0r 100. That is Gann’s “D0llar Value.” 1 0nly d0 this when the range is bey0nd

Figure 28.9 sh0uld l00k very familiar n0w. It has bec0me the re- lentless beat in 20I8 which we have tracked thr0ugh0ut the b00k in the 5&Ps0OO daily chart. All 1 need t0 see is when the next market beat will fall 0n day 289 0r the square 0f I7 as started fr0m the February 8, 20I8 l0w. It is a Thanksgiving H0liday. N0rmally a sell0ff c0mes int0 the h0liday and the seas0nals then rally 0ut 0f the h0liday. The market is 0n a fan angle. The C0mp0site Index Oscillat0r is tuming up. What c0uld 90 wr0ng? We have a waming.

Figure 28.IO sh0ws that the 5&PSOO is als0 0n a I44-calendar day c0unt. That means that the N0vember 22/23 Thanksgiving h0liday is 0n a square 0f I7 and a square 0f I2 bar c0unt which we first de- vel0ped in Figure 26.28 and is n0w updated in Figure 28.9. The c0n- fluence is interesting, but there is a waming f0r an experienced Gann analyst wh0 kn0ws the next Time Fact0r near December 2S—28, 20I8 is d0sely c0upled t0 a T0tal Lunar Edipse 0n January 4, 20I9. These Time Fact0rs t0gether have a greater weighting near the end 0f the year. It means this Time Fact0r n0w at Thanksgiving is p0ssibly a sh0rt-term reversal that will fail all0wing a m0re significant price b0tt0m int0 the last maj0r Time Fact0r next m0nth. The French CAC has the dearest Elli0tt Wave pattem (Expanded Flat) and wams the French CAC c0uld lead Eur0pe and N0rth America 0ut 0f this c0r- recti0n with just 0ne swing d0wn. 1 have been leaning 0n the CAC market f0r dients as it helped us thr0ugh0ut the c0rrective dedine in the 5&P SOO. Analysis is always a balance 0f n0n-c0rrelated meth0ds. Apple (AAPL), barely sh0wing in a daily chart 0n the right side 0f Figure 28.IO, is 0n a maj0r supp0rt z0ne as derived fr0m Fib0nacci c0nfluence. D0 we have any 0ther guidance? Yes. We c0vered in

64I

Chapter 23 that the critical fact0r f0r a T0tal Lunar Edipse is the di- recti0n 0ut 0f the edipse. A market can extend a full m0nth int0 the next New M00n fr0m the trend directi0n after the edipse. Kn0wing this helps us determine h0w t0 read these tw0 c0nfluence Time Fact0rs between Thanksgiving and the cyde appr0aching near the Christmas h0lidays. C0uld Eur0pe extend d0wn a full m0nth after January’s T0tal Lunar Edipse? It is t00 0vers0ld n0w f0r this t0 fit well. The C0mp0site Index likes t0 create a “W’ pattem at maj0r b0tt0m re- versals. That is the pattem f0rming in several markets. Besides, markets seem t0 l0ve t0 catch traders when m0st are n0t paying at- tenti0n during key h0lidays and sec0nd-string traders are manning the trading desks.

Figure 28.11 sh0ws the DJIA daily chart with Price square Satum. On the right is the 6O-minute intraday chart f0r the YM2I8 E-mini DJIA Futures December 20I8 C0ntract. The astr0l0gical events being tracked 0n the 6O-minute data are Chir0n Semi-Sextile M00n, M00n Opp0siti0n Ceres, M00n I2° Ceres. The first time they dustered t0- gether near the middle 0f the 6O-minute chart the Elli0tt Wave c0unt was inc0mplete. This is wave ‘3’. A f0urth wave up is needed that will fail leading t0 an0ther dr0p. The C0mp0site Index is 0n a buy signal. Please refer t0 my b00k, Technical Analysis f0r the Trading Pr0fes- st0nal if this signal d0es n0t l00k familiar t0 y0u. Clearly, kn0wing the Elli0tt Wave Principle made a big difference because wave ‘3’ d0wn had dusters that will bring in early buyers. Y0u kn0w t0 wait f0r the next set 0f astr0l0gical events int0 the end 0f the year.

T0day is N0vember 28, 20I8. Figure 28.I2 sh0ws y0u what is de- vel0ping n0w. We kn0w this ‘sw00sh’ up is a f0urth wave c0rrecti0n. T0day the DJIA is up 6I7 p0ints the pe0ple sing and cheer. 5&PSOO futures? Up 67.SO. T0night, 1’ll w0rk 0n what’s next. My pattem is a c0nstant. T0night, 1 must study sect0rs and maj0r st0cks within the m0ve. It all c0mes as a package; y0u have t0 dissect thr0ugh the vari0us levels. The questi0ns asked at the end 0f the day are always different and the meth0ds 1 may use always vary based 0n what the market puzzle dictates. The questi0n t0night will be whether this is being c0rrectly defined as a f0urth wave rally. Y0u must kn0w Eu- r0pe’s p0siti0n in all this. A Brexit v0te is c0ming next week. 1 am aware 0f it, but it d0es n0t influence the chart w0rk. F0rtunately, my charts need little adjustment after a day like this. Based 0n a pre- liminary view 0f leading st0cks, this m0ve will be entirely retraced.

Figure 28.I3 sh0ws the December 20I8 5&PSOO c0ntract in a I20- minute bar chart. It sh0ws y0u the Square 0f Nine targets fr0m tw0 different starting price levels. The 2,7SS—2,7S8 price level is significant. Chapter 29 will discuss h0w t0 devel0p c0nfluence targets using a Gann Wheel. Figure 28.I3 sh0uld have cydes y0u easily understand n0w. As an example, 1 h0pe y0u recall that Sun 4°, tracks a 1-meridian line 0f Earth’s r0tati0n. M00n I8° still applies in intraday charts... I8, 36, 72, I44.

The Square 0f Nine was first placed using a price unit that was the same aspect rati0 as the chart, but the intervals between targets were

All the charts in this b00k were captured in real-time and then dis- cussed that evening f0r the b00k.

CHAPTER 29

Less0n Nine: Time/ Price Charts—The Gann Wheels

There c0mes a p0int in time when y0u awake 0ne m0ming and find y0u have s0meh0w cr0ssed the line and bec0me teacher rather than student in 0ther pe0ple’s minds. Being a Y0da brings with it new resp0nsibilities and pressures t0 get it right. Y0u suddenly verify everything y0u pass 0n, increasing the w0rkl0ad substantially. But being a Y0da als0 brings with it s0me degree 0f respect because it was eamed thr0ugh hard w0rk. 1 value that a l0t.

One day 1 was c0ntacted by a f0rmer executive 0f the Chartered Market Ass0ciati0n wh0 was head 0f the CMT pr0gram. He wanted me t0 give a presentati0n f0r them ab0ut cydes; he was eager t0 use my presentati0n materials as a res0urce in their B0dy 0f Kn0wledge. M0st 0f the f0rmulas in that b0dy 0f w0rk had passed thr0ugh my hands f0r verificati0n years a90. 1 was very familiar with it and with the B0dy 0f Kn0wledge pr0ject champi0ned by Fred Meisser years a90. That was then, and things had apparently changed. The executive added in a waming v0ice, “Y0u will give a presentati0n 0n Cydes, but MAY NOT reference anything t0 d0 with Gann.”

1 asked, “Why?”

He explained, “Y0u d0n’t kn0w anything ab0ut Gann.”

1 replied, “Y0u just t0ld me 1 was ‘basically just a cydes analyst.’ Are y0u aware everything Gann did was ab0ut cydes?” Admittedly, 1 was a zad insulted that my eight b00ks c0vering a wide range 0f t0pics had just been trashed by an executive 0f my 0wn 0rganizati0n.

Then 1 began t0 smile thinking, “S0meday, Mr. Kumquat... are y0u in f0r a big surprise.”

He went 0n and stated, “Y0u are n0t t0 discuss Gann, and that’s final. We have an expert.”

“Really?” 1 replied. “1 w0uld be curi0us t0 kn0w wh0 that is.” While 1 have n0t met all the Gann experts, we are small in number and we all at least kn0w 0f 0ne an0ther. 1 sure w0uld be interested t0 kn0w wh0 they felt held that p0siti0n in my 0rganizati0n.

1 gave my presentati0n 0nline... and it neatly dr0pped bread- crumbs d0wn the r0ad t0ward Gann. Then 1 charged straight int0 Gann head-0n sh0wing Gann’s Permanent NYSE table (which we c0vered much earlier) and a few str0ng examples 0f Gann’s astr0- n0mical cydes applied in vari0us markets with cirdes and arr0ws 0n each 0ne. The Arl0 Guthrie s0ng, “Alice’s Restaurant” was ringing in my ears where Arl0 sang ab0ut being arrested f0r n0t picking up the garbage; and sitting 0n the “Gr0up W” bench, and Officer Obie’s evidence 0f incriminati0n with cirdes and arr0ws and a paragraph 0n the back 0f each and every 0ne 0f them 8 x IO gl0ssy pictures... Well, s0me 0f y0u will kn0w what 1 mean and will recall h0w that half-h0ur s0ng 90es. F0r my fl0wer-child generati0n that s0ng was an anthem 0f defiance against auth0rity. Seems 1 had n0t leamed a thing 0ver all these many years.

In 20I8 1 was stripped 0f the “CMT” that 1’ve held since I99I. Yes,

1 had been a CMT 11I grader, edit0r 0f the J0umal, written endless questi0ns f0r the CMT 11I exams, and my b00k Technical Analysis f0r the Trading Pr0fessi0nal was 0n the required reading list f0r CMT 11I f0r many years, but 1 finally refused t0 pay int0 their annual annuity plan. One d0es n0t h0ld a Master’s degree 0n the c0nditi0n the uni- versity kn0ws y0u have paid y0ur alumni dues. 1 much prefer the Intemati0nal Federati0n 0f Technical Analysts (IFTA.0rg) wh0 let their h0lders 0f high standards certificati0n retain their licenses f0r a lifetime whether y0u are a member 0r n0t. Several members 0f IFTA were the sp0ns0rs enc0uraging me t0 write this w0rk, such as R0n William. It is imp0rtant t0 kn0w that pe0ple are 0ffering enc0ur- agement. It helps y0u muster the c0urage t0 write it all d0wn s0 that the w0rld can kick the tires 0f y0ur lifel0ng search.

H0wever, the Mr. Kumquats in my w0rld are als0 t0 be thanked. Why? With0ut them 1 w0uld n0t have decided t0 use the f0rmat y0u are ab0ut t0 see. It will give y0u the b00k page, the exact reference, and then f0ll0w that by giving y0u the Time/Price chart Gann was flagging us t0 study al0ng with the details 0f h0w t0 read it. Yes, all with the incriminating cirdes and arr0ws needed t0 verify Gann’s text descripti0n... and a paragraph explaining each 0ne. It’s 90ing t0 help every0ne! This is what pe0ple have wanted. When the 2-by-4 hit me 0ver the head ab0ut h0w t0 pr0ceed and structure this chapter, 1 was excited t0 get 90ing.

A. THE HEXAGON—AN INTRODUCTION

Gann’s Price-Time 0r Time-Price Charts are the Wheels he invented, and in my 0pini0n, they are brilliant calculat0rs. They are used in several different ways.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

A 900d beginning is t0 get a feel 0f what y0u are l00king at in Figure 29.A.This isa Hexa90n Wheel. The number zer0 is the center pin. Then the numbers 0ne thr0ugh six m0ve c0unterd0ckwise in the first inner ring. We call this a r0tati0n. Each r0tati0n adds an0ther six numbers. N0tice the angle between numbers 6 and 7. They d0 n0t m0ve 0ut 0n the h0riz0ntal axis when beginning a new r0tati0n. One has t0 jump t0 the next ring and t0 the left t0 track fr0m ‘6’ t0 ‘7.’

Within the numbers 0f the Hexa90n is 0ne planet glyph f0r the M00n. There is n0 number 3I but we kn0w M00n is 0ver the number 3I because 0f the tw0 visible numbers 0n either side. We can see 30 and 32 in the third r0tati0n. M00n p0siti0ned 0ver 3I means that this is the M00n’s l0ngitude p0siti0n. M00n is at 3I° l0ngitude, and we d0 n0t kn0w the fracti0nal minutes unless we m0ve 0ur m0use 0ver the M00n glyph. Then we disc0ver that M00n is stati0ned at 3I° 30’. This is 1° 30° Taurus.

Fr0m the 0utside ring, c0unt the 0utside ring as ‘0ne’ and m0ve in t0 ring ‘5.’ This ring has the planet glyphs.

Ring ‘0ne’ 0r the 0utside ring sh0ws a dial 0f angles m0ving c0un- terd0ckwise. D0 n0t f0rget that the z0diac signs m0ve c0unter- d0ckwise. The 0utside ring is c0rrect. But 1 have had t0 manually add this 0uter ring because the rings with angles in the center neither m0ve c0rrectly n0r run c0unterd0ckwise. The Wheels are being c0m- pletely redesigned as 1 must admit 1 have always had t0 use physical Wheels due t0 the many issues with the pr0gram. 1 kn0w the many requests are being implemented, but 1 will n0t be able t0 revise the b00k charts as they will c0me in t00 late after we hit ‘l0ck-d0wn. We can w0rk with it.

Ring number ‘tw0’ sh0ws dates. 1 have manually changed the 0pti0n, s0 the dates als0 m0ve c0unterd0ckwise. The date ring will

enlarge dates every 30° fr0m March 2I. These are the “natural” dates.

The f0urth ring fr0m the 0utside nearest the planet glyphs, sh0ws angles in degrees again. This ring is set at “0” S0uth because 1 dicked 0n the glyph f0r Uranus. F0r 0ur purp0ses in this intr0ducti0n, the 0° angle must be set at 0° by dicking 0n a planet glyph in the fifth ring. It is imp0rtant—the 0° setting sh0uld be 0n the sl0wer m0ving planet f0rming the aspect. This tells the c0mputer where t0 start the subdivisi0ns we want spaced ar0und the Hexa90n. The subdivisi0ns are the sp0kes radiating 0utwards fr0m the center pin. The templates 1 selected were semi-sextile, 0r 30° subdivisi0ns ar0und the wheel. Then 1 added a sec0nd template t0 mark Square. Square cr0sshairs will 0verlap semi-sextile subdivisi0ns, but the 0verlap 0f the tw0 tem- plates creates the darker gray sp0kes.

The wider gray axis bar running N0rth t0 S0uth is a user defined aid that can be m0ved t0 any l0cati0n y0u want with a fixed center fulcrum p0int. It just helps align r0ws, c0lumns, 0r dia90nal radian lines 0f numbers s0 we stay within the bar’s b0undary.

Ring five with the planet glyphs will be used thr0ugh0ut this intr0ducti0n.

Referencing the 0utside ring, we see an 0val 0n the ‘S0uth’ axis c0ntaining 9O° and the planet glyphs f0r Uranus and Venus in ring 5. They are nearly c0njunct 0ne an0ther. There is ab0ut 4° separati0n if we l00k at a ring with angles t0 c0mpare the spacing between the tw0 glyphs. If y0u need the display t0 be m0re exact just m0ve y0ur m0use 0ver the glyphs. We need 2°s 0r + 1° 0f exact. This came very d0se. If we widened the 0rb, the planets w0uld be c0njunct.

F0ll0w the axis arm that aligns the ‘S0uth’ 9O° t0 the center 0f the wheel. 1 have cirded the number S4. A Venus c0njunct Uranus cul-

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

minati0n and the number S4 are 0n the same axis. This w0uld be a Gann price target. Any number 0n this axis int0 the center is a price level viewed t0 be a c0njuncti0n. But there is an0ther aspect here. The price S4 w0uld be c0njunct Uranus and Venus. The numbers 15, 3I%, 82%, 117, and 157% in the same c0lumn are all prices c0njunct Venus and Uranus when the tw0 planets 0verlap 0r shift just slightly d0ser t0gether. If y0u cr0ssed the center and m0ved t0 the 0pp0site radian, the relati0nship w0uld be an 0pp0siti0n t0 Uranus 0r Venus. As an example, the number 42 w0uld be in 0pp0siti0n because it is the 0pp0site side 0f the center pin.

If we l00k up the axis fr0m 9O° again 0n the s0uth radian t0 the center, then m0ve West t0 0°, (the 0utside ring) we w0uld cr0ss thr0ugh the glyph f0r Mars 0n Aries 0°. This means there is a Mars Square Uranus aspect as well. We als0 are near a Mars Square Venus aspect, but it may be 1° t0 the 0utside 0f the culminati0n 0rb that we deem acceptable. H0w w0uld we read a price target within a Square aspect? Rec0gnize anytime 1 add a template such as sextile 0r trine t0 my display, it is t0 subdivide the wide spacing within the 9O° arc 0r quarter 0f the cirde. Figure 29.A sh0ws that the SW quarter 0f the cirde is divided int0 thirds. If 1 had wanted the midp0int 0f the square aspect, 1 w0uld use a semi-square template. While the h0ri- z0ntal and vertical axes define the square aspect, the price targets we will extract fr0m the Wheel will be l0cated 0n the radian lines 0f the 0verlay such as the angles that cr0ss thr0ugh 11I and 114. N0t ap- pr0priate f0r y0ur market? 15O% and 154 are als0 price targets 0n the same angles. That’s the general idea, just t0 get y0u started. Yes, a price that falls 0n the 0° axis w0uld als0 be a target, but the numbers between 0° and 9O° are very wide apart. Theref0re, prices 0n angles ge0metrically related t0 the square are just as valid.

A natural p0int

Figure 29.1. Page 15S, H0w T0 Make Pr0fits in C0mm0dities, W.D. Gann —CORN—“I932—April L0w 27/2”.

What ab0ut ring number three? Just ign0re it in these charts. It is fixed in the pr0gram at the m0ment and 1 cann0t rem0ve it.

Let me sh0w y0u exactly what Gann was teaching us within H0w t0 Make Pr0fits in C0mm0dities. 1 will be referencing the I9SI editi0n this time. 1 will als0 try t0 make the images as large as appr0priate f0r the discussi0n, but this is 90ing t0 be an eyestrain. 1 will keep this in mind and z00m in after y0u bec0me m0re familiar with the lay0ut.

Figure 29.1 is fr0m page 15S where CORN is listed as “I932 — April L0w 27/%c.”

Figure 29.2 is the Hexa90n Chart. The center pin is zer0. The first r0tati0n has the numbers 0ne t0 six. The number seven begins the next r0tati0n but pay attenti0n t0 the angle which begins the next ring.

The numbers in the sec0nd r0tati0n c0ntinue t0 the number I8. The Planet glyph f0r Uranus is c0vering the number I9. The number I9 is c0vered because Uranus is stati0ned at I9° l0ngitude if y0u scan 0ver t0 the Ephemeris listing 0n the upper left. Y0u will find a black arr0w t0 help y0u c0nnect Satum’s l0ngitude 0f 303° 44’ t0 the number 303 in the Hexa90n Chart. All the Planet glyphs c0ver the c0rrect l0n- gitude numbers within the wheel as n0tated in the ephemeris.

N0w here is why s0 many pe0ple struggle with Gann’s b00k. F0r m0re than 9O%-+ 0f the c0rrect market references t0 be identified within H0w T0 Make Pr0fits, y0u have t0 kn0w the encrypti0n key. The first

part was identified by Patrick Mikula. It is the w0rd “Natural.” But Patrick never used Wheat in his examples because there is a sec0nd encrypti0n c0de 1 f0und. The w0rd is “0ne-half” s0metimes presented with 0r with0ut “50%,” s0metimes just 2. Wherever these tw0 en- crypti0n keys c0mbine within the b00k, Gann is giving us a marker p0inting t0 an imp0rtant astr0l0gical event that he wants us t0 leam. The rest 0f the b00k? J0hn Gann’s endless listings 0f percentages are all cam0uflage! If y0u did n0t kn0w t0 t0ss all th0se references 0ut

the wind0w, y0u w0uld never find the f0ll0wing. Here’s h0w it w0rks.

Figure 29.1 0nly has half the encrypti0n key. That’s Okay. Gann states that this is back t0 the l0ws 0f I897. The year I897 is itself very special as it is a c0merst0ne Gann describes in his b00ks. What we want t0 understand is the date “I932—April, L0w 27%c.” H0w d0es Gann get this price?

It helps having 90ne thr0ugh his pers0nal ephemeris kn0wing that he 0ften c0mbines Venus—Satum aspects in C0njuncti0ns, Opp0- siti0ns, Squares, and Trines. S0, we are sent back t0 April 0f I932. He d0es n0t give the date, which means that every0ne pre-c0mputer era had t0 d0 all the calculati0ns by hand 0r hunt thr0ugh an Ephemeris table. Ugh. We get t0 use a handy-dandy date slider and watch the aspects flash aligned as the time slider changes. On April 8, I932 there

is a Venus Trine Satum culminati0n. We als0 have Uranus Square Plut0. Let’s l00k at the Venus Trine Satum first.

In Figure 29.2 we first set the c0rrect date in the pr0perties wind0w t0 April 8, I932. It is in a list 0f 0pti0ns 0n the far left n0t seen in this figure as the chart is small en0ugh. (D0 ign0re the 0utside ring with dates as we are n0t using them just yet.)

Then set 0° 0n the planet that is the sl0west. D0 this by just dicking 0n the glyph f0r Satum n0w in the f0urth ring c0unting fr0m the 0utside. The nearest ring t0 Satum is n0w set 0n the 0° angle. D0 n0t dick the glyph inside the wheel 0f numbers!

1 kn0w Venus is Trine Satum because 0f the ephemeris in the b0tt0m left 0f this figure. 1 add the 0verlay template ‘Trine.’ It creates the faint s0ft gray lines with sufficient transparency 1 can still see numbers under the radian arms.

Outside are tw0 black 0vals c0ntaining planet glyphs f0r Venus and Satum. Each is aligned t0 an axis radian. They sh0w the I20° sepa- rati0n between Venus and Satum. The darker bar cr0ssing thr0ugh Satum is just the user axis which 1 can m0ve anywhere. F0r n0w, 1 am n0t 90ing t0 m0ve it away fr0m Satum because 1 am reading the numbers al0ng the same radian that is 0pp0site the midp0int between

the Venus Trine Satum aspect. 1 am n0t using the axis aligned t0 Satum. The inner black 0val highlights the price 274. Gann had 27%. We just duplicated what Gann wanted us t0 leam t0 within ‘4. That gets us started.

We kn0w fr0m the ephemeris in Figure 29.2 that there is als0 a Uranus Square Plut0 aspect. Let’s see if Gann was referencing this aspect rather than Venus Trine Satum.

N0thing has changed in Figure 29.3 c0mpared t0 Figure 29.2 except the template 0verlay. Y0u will see Jupiter is still stati0ned 0n I32° L0ngitude within the hexa90n. 1 deleted the Trine 0verlay and kept a Square 0verlay. Uranus and Plut0 are p0siti0ned 0n the square subdi- visi0ns. Plut0 is sl0wer than Uranus. Click 0n Plut0 0n the f0urth ring. The angle ring nearest the Plut0 glyph is n0w set at 0°. That means the square 0verlay is starting fr0m this reference p0int. C0nfirm we did it c0rrectly. Tw0 arms, 0r radians, 0f the template cr0ss thr0ugh Plut0 and Uranus. N0w we can hunt f0r price.

The black 0val 0n the b0tt0m left sh0ws that the radian cr0sses thr0ugh the number 28. This is a 4 cent 0ff fr0m Gann’s 27/. It is acceptable if within 1 cent. S0, either aspect w0uld give the c0rrect price, but the Venus Trine Satum aspect was '4 cent d0ser.

The next example is Figure 29.4 sh0wing pages 156 (b0tt0m) and 157 (t0p). Here we have b0th encrypti0n keys “natural” and “50%.” We kn0w fr0m Tunnel and Gann’s reference t0 the Bible that when it is very imp0rtant he repeats things three times as in the Bible. Here he repeats 50% three times. Why is this 0ne date s0 imp0rtant?

This 0ne is tricky. There is a retr0grade that will mess y0u up with a later date. The real date is 0n March 30, I934 where a Venus C0n- juncti0n Satum culminates. We kn0w t0 expect 0pp0siti0ns and c0n- juncti0ns t0 be a big deal fr0m all the 0ther w0rk we have c0vered.

F0ll0w the same steps. Set the date t0 March 30, I934. 1 used an ephemeris t0 find the exact date 0f the Venus Satum aspect. S0metimes 1 was wr0ng due t0 the retr0grade m0ti0n and knew it because it w0uld n0t pr0duce the c0rrect price. H0wever, d0n’t misunderstand this c0mment because Gann d0es use planets in retr0grade, just n0t in this example.

Click 0n Satum t0 set the 0° f0r the angle template. Because it is a c0njuncti0n, 1 add tw0 templates, Square and Sextile, t0 break d0wn the wide range between 0° and I8O°. The glyphs Venus and Satum have a black 0val ar0und them sh0wing the c0njuncti0n in Figure 29.5. N0tice that 0° 0n the nearby ring is slightly t0 the left 0f the planet glyphs. My m0veable axis is shifted right where 0° sh0uld be p0siti0ned. The s0ftware l0cks t0 a price within the wheel and cann0t see fracti0nal degrees in the versi0n 1 have. They will w0rk t0 make this m0re accurate. This is Okay. We have the m0veable axis, and 1 m0ve it 0ver the c0njuncti0n. Be careful that the axis is 0n Satum, the sl0wer planet. Tw0 black arr0ws sh0w y0u the small difference between the template start and the axis placement. N0w the price 0n ‘square’ angle t0 the c0njuncti0n is 0n 39’. But shift the reading slightly up because 0f the 0ffset 0f y0ur template. It will be 0n 4O exactly. Gann gave us “I934—April L0w 4O.” We have it.

Again, Gann just gives us the m0nth and year in Figure 29.8, but we must 90 all the way back t0 the I8OOs t0 find the cyde c0merst0nes f0r Gann. All the I8OOs dates are imp0rtant. 1 use an ephemeris first. 1 purchased a nineteenth-century Raphael ephemeris fr0m France. There are s0me differences. My s0ftware pr0duces a Venus Trine Satum culminati0n 0n Oct0ber I3, I8S6, in Figure 29.9. But fr0m an earlier chapter, we kn0w that this date is als0 a T0tal Lunar Edipse. Which 0ne will it be that gives us Gann’s price?

Figure 29.9 is the ephemeris chart f0r Oct0ber I3, I8S6.

Figure 29.IO is the Hexa90n chart f0r Oct0ber I3, I8S6. Ign0re the fact that the dates 90 d0ckwise; 1 f0r90t t0 invert them again, but we will n0t be using them just yet. The imp0rtant thing is t0

set the c0rrect date in the pr0perties wind0w 0n the left. (N0t in view.)

Let’s study the Venus Trine Satum aspect. 1 dick 0n Satum t0 set the Trine 0verlay t0 start 0° aligned with Satum. The price 0f 77 cann0t be 0btained fr0m this aspect. H0wever, the T0tal Lunar Edipse is marked with the heavy black arr0w c0nnecting M00n and Sun. The arr0w line is cr0ssing directly thr0ugh the number 77. That is the astr0l0gical event Gann is using. In a Lunar Edipse the Earth bl0cks the Sun’s rays falling 0n the M00n.

Next, 1 w0ndered why Gann added t0 the I9SI editi0n page 32I f0r S0ybeans. He gives us the day and date 0f “S0ybeans—September 2S, I9SO, Prices dedined t0 23I'4”.

Figure 29.11. Page 32I, H0w t0 Make Pr0fits (I9SI ed.)—S0ybeans Sept 2S, I9SO. “Prices dedined t0 23I4.”

Figure 29.11 sh0ws we have b0th the encrypti0n keys in this entry 0n page 32I, th0ugh “% p0int” is a different use 0f the “4” encrypti0n key. We als0 have a play 0n numbers that maybe means s0mething 0r n0t. Page 32I and price 23I'4. 1 finally decided: N0t. Tunnel messes with y0ur mind always.

Gann spells 0ut a date f0r us with S0ybeans. First th0ught was, “great... an easy 0ne c0ming.” N0t a chance. He is teaching us s0mething new. This was the t0ughest 0ne f0r me until 1 recalled the instructi0ns Gann gave Kennelw0rth in Tunnel. Figure 29.11 is Gann’s entry f0r September 2S, I9SO. The pr0blem is the date. There is a T0tal Lunar Edipse September 26, I9SO. The “natural” date was September 23. September 2S is n0t the midp0int between the tw0 dates. Why is Gann a day early?

1 aband0n September 2Sth. Figure 29.I2 sh0ws y0u September 26th, I9SO. The year itself was defined 0n page 320 in Gann’s b00k. While there is a T0tal Lunar Edipse 0n this day, y0u cann0t find Gann’s price the way we f0und it in an earlier example f0r a Lunar Edipse. Later the same day M00n transits t0 Square Uranus. Set 0° 0n Uranus and eureka! Exact. The axis falls exactly 0n 23I/4. It is an0ther applicati0n 0f reading a 9O° angle fr0m an edipse. Having t0 wait f0r the aspect with Uranus bef0re taking the price calculati0n is teaching us s0mething new in the I9SI editi0n. 1 am still pr0cessing this 0ne myself but based 0n what we kn0w fr0m Tunnel ab0ut 9O° calendar day pr0jecti0ns fr0m the edipse, it w0uld make sense that 9O° aspects w0uld be used by Gann as well.

Is there any questi0n why the principle characters in Tunnel are acr0nyms f0r Venus, Jupiter, and Satum?

There is m0re t0 leam ab0ut the Hexa90n. Once y0u understand the Square 0f Nine, y0u will kn0w h0w t0 use the Hexa90n t0 0btain price targets. But y0u n0w kn0w h0w t0 read prices within the Hexa90n wheel, set 0verlays, and read aspects t0 the 0verlay templates. Y0u understand that the glyphs within the wheel f0r planets sh0w their l0ngitude p0siti0ns by the number they c0ver. Then y0u leamed h0w t0 break Gann’s encrypti0n key in H0w T0 Make Pr0fits. N0t a bad beginning. Oh, 1 nearly f0r90t t0 answer a questi0n. 1 said all the ref- erences in the I8OOs were imp0rtant. Here’s the easy answer: February I866, Price 33%, find Venus square Satum, price is exactly 0n 33/2 when y0u f0ll0w the radian t0ward Venus. Oct0ber I884, Price 34/2, Venus square Satum. Price is 0n a Sextile radian line. 1 get 34’4. N0w all y0u need d0 is find the exact date these aspects culminate.

There’s m0re t0 c0me regarding the Hexa90n; we will be retuming.

B. THE SQUARE OF NINE—AN INTRODUCTION

The Square 0f Nine. We have arrived. We have much t0 c0ver. Less0n 0ne: The Square 0f Nine is n0t a cirde. S0me0ne 0nline wanted t0 argue with me that the Square 0f Nine c0uld be a cirde because Gann never sh0wed us 0r wr0te anything ab0ut it being square. Yah, right. That was funny. Clearly that pers0n had never read any 0f Gann’s c0urses. In Gann’s c0urse called Speculati0n A Pr0f- itable Pr0fessi0n: A C0urse 0f Instructi0ns 0n Grains, there is a picture 0f Gann’s Square 0f Nine seen in Figure 29.15. It has been digitally enhanced t0 sharpen the image the best we c0uld as m0st versi0ns are t0tally illegible. There are several things t0 p0int 0ut. Gann d0es n0t have an 0utside dial with angles 0n it. See the three rings inside the

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

wheel? He used these intemal rings t0 help determine angles. The sp0kes fr0m the center are marked as angles and serve as an 0verlay template. The numbers increase d0ckwise in increments 0f +1. We, 0r m0st likely Billy J0nes, added the 0uter dials t0 make 0ur lives easier. We like that m0dificati0n.

While the cardinal directi0ns p0inting N0rth-S0uth and West— East are marked with a d0uble line in Gann’s Wheel, the quarter year 0f the cirde is subdivided by f0ur with each divisi0n 22.5 degrees 0f separati0n. When we add all the c0nventi0nal 0verlays 0f square, semi-square, trines, and semi-sextile subdivisi0ns, they cann0t du- plicate the 0verlays within Gann’s Wheel in Figure 29.15. 1 w0uld need an 0verlay... ready f0r this 0ne... called a Hexakaideca90n 0r hexadeca90n.

Kn0wing each quarter 0f the cirde is subdivided by f0ur, we kn0w each I8O° half cirde is divided int0 eighths. (Gann’s meth0ds d0 indeed repeat themselves.) The full cirde has I6 equal subdivisi0ns separated by 22.5 degrees. S0me students will be very surprised by this because every b00k 1 have seen repr0duces this chart as th0ugh Gann subdivided a quarter cirde int0 three divisi0ns. He did n0t. It seems n0b0dy has picked up this ge0metric c0nflict between Gann’s ge0metry and likely Billy J0nes’s. Y0u d0n’t believe me, d0 y0u. C0unt the number 0f listed numbers fr0m the middle 0n the t0p r0w as ‘0ne’ 90ing left. Then c0unt t0 the middle radian. Then c0unt fr0m the divider as ‘0ne’ t0 the t0p left c0mer. Y0u will get the same c0unt 0n either side—nine. N0w c0unt the numbers in the 0utside c0lumn fr0m the t0p left c0mer. Again, c0unt the c0mer as ‘0ne’ d0wn the c0lumn 0n the left t0 the middle divider radian. There are nine. Fr0m the divider line c0unt ‘0ne.’ The c0unt ends 0n ‘9’ 0n the due West axis. Equality.

67O

We kn0w 22.5 is imp0rtant. It has been menti0ned in this b00k several times within different c0ntexts. F0r example, Chapter One ref- erenced: “The bank 90es public t0 raise much-needed funds t0 c0ver their l0sses. The IPO 0ffering was August 2I, I86S. The st0ck high was 22.5 0n N0vember I6, I86S.” Chapter 22 referenced: “Instead 0f the Square 0f 9O, we are really using the Square 0f 4S when 1 draw an angle 0f 22.SO. But the 4S° angle and 22.5° angle are parallel.”

Gann knew everything had interchanging pr0perties. A 22.5° angle and a 22.5 price high bef0re a panic 0f hist0ric pr0p0rti0ns are all in- terchangeable when we d0 0ur analysis w0rk 0n a Wheel.

But there is an0ther reas0n that is m0re imp0rtant. We n0w un- derstand the mathematics behind the Law 0f Vibrati0n. Is it any w0nder Gann is using a divisi0n 0f ‘2’ and ‘4’ and n0t *3’ in a Square 0f Nine? The Hexa90n is the king 0f ‘3’s. This d0es n0t mean we will n0t use trine calculati0ns fr0m the Square 0f Nine, but the Hexa90n d0es a better j0b 0n 3s and the Square 0f Nine d0es a better j0b f0r markets that run 0n 2s, 4s and 8s. What d0es the IBM trader use? The Hexa90n, as that is a Trine st0ck. What d0es the 5&P trader use? The Square 0f Nine. The Wheels are n0t 0ne-size-fits-all markets.

In Figure 29.15 it will be hard t0 read the n0tati0ns 0n the end 0f each sp0ke. The c0py in Gann’s c0urse is harder t0 read. Starting at the t0p N0rth radian, it reads June 22 0n the t0p line, an aspect n0- tati0n, and the line under that says 9O°. Okay, d0es Gann put 36O°/0° 0n the West 0r East? Assume n0thing with Gann. The b0rder entry 0n the West reads ‘March 2I’, a trine aspect, and then 36O° (0°)—n0 surprises here.

Gann’s dates m0ve d0ckwise fr0m spring, March 22, 0n ‘West’ t0 June 2I 0n the N0rth. The S0uth axis is December 22. The b0tt0m left c0mer is m0st intriguing. He wr0te a p0ssible c0merst0ne year

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

in... I8S4 (2). Very hard t0 read but seems t0 be a year 0n the b0tt0m left c0mer and n0t a n0tati0n f0r a day and m0nth. The aspect n0tati0ns are f0r a specific time. That w0uld make sense. Gann is calculating cydes fr0m the c0merst0ne angle. F0rtunately, we d0 n0t have t0 create such charts by hand. But creating a Wheel that marked the c0merst0ne f0r y0ur grain market makes m0re sense than any reas0n 1 can think 0f f0r these unexpected differences in his chart.

Why d0 the dates thr0ugh the year m0ve d0ckwise? Figure 29.15 sh0ws that the Square 0f Nine numbers are m0ving d0ckwise. But the d0ckwise dates all0w a calendar-day c0unt that is ascending. If y0u are w0rking with supp0rt dates, y0ur calendar w0uld n0t 90 backwards in time t0 find the next target. We w0uld theref0re have t0 reverse the 0uter dial s0 that the dates w0uld m0ve c0unterd0ckwise, yet f0rward in time.

Gann likely knew in his head that a l0ngitude 0f 303 w0uld be 3° Aquarius, 0r else he used the f0rmula we c0vered. There is als0 a third way that uses a reference table like the 0ne 1 made f0r y0u in Appendix L.

The Square 0f Nine is a calculat0r f0r squares and square r00ts— an0ther 900d reas0n t0 divide the quarter year by f0ur rather than three. One/sixteenth 0f a year is 3.2S weeks. If y0u retum t0 Figure 26.5, Gann’s table is a calculat0r f0r 6.5-week increments, and he added the 4% and % increments as well. The 6.5 increment is an im- p0rtant interval.

An0ther characteristic 0f the Square 0f Nine is its l0garithmic pr0p- erties which we visually c0nfirmed in Chapter I3 in Figure I3.IO, with the Nikkei 2-m0nth chart.

En0ugh basics; h0w d0es this Wheel w0rk?

29. Less0n Nine: Time/Price Charts—The Gann Wheels

C. THE SQUARE OF NINE

Figure 29.I6 displays the number sequence 0f the Square 0f Nine as Gann dem0nstrated his Wheel in his c0urses. The center pin is the number ‘0ne’. Fr0m there we jump t0 the left 0n the h0riz0ntal axis t0 the number ‘2’. M0ving d0ckwise the first r0tati0n ends 0n ‘9’— the reas0n it is called the Square 0f Nine. This number sequence has a deep and rich hist0ry in India’s culture. We will just pass 0n by and jump t0 the next r0tati0n that begins 0n the number IO and c0ntinues t0 the number 2S. Pay attenti0n here. Every time y0u reach the b0tt0m left c0mer y0u must jump 0utside the framed b0x t0 the next. The 0val in Figure 29.I6 highlights the p0siti0n 0f numbers 2S and 26. Just be very careful ab0ut this c0mer as many err0rs are made here.

The Square 0f Nine is a Helix. (Figures I3.1, I3.7 and I3.8 in Chapter I3.) It is the 0ne flaw 0f Gann’s Square 0f Nine design. Rather than thin 0utlines 0f sequential squares, the intemal c0lumn and r0w subdivisi0ns sh0uld have been drawn as a spiral, s0 that the manual wheel d0es n0t f0rce us t0 jump 0utside a b0x every time we appr0ach the S0uth-West c0mer.

The s0ft gray descending dia90nal axis t0 the b0tt0m left c0mer shades the sequence 0f 0dd squares; 3 by 3, 5 by 5, 7 by 7, and s0 f0rth. N0tice that 36I, 0r the I9 by I9 we discussed, is 0n this dia90nal axis t0 the b0tt0m left c0mer. It must be 0n a c0mer. The Wheel is n0t ab0ut any 0ne number, it is ab0ut the relati0nship a number will have t0 a series 0f numbers c0nnected by harm0nic intervals. If y0u skipped the early chapters, y0u are in deep tr0uble n0w. N0 mercy.

If y0u l00k at the dia90nal r0w 0f numbers running just ab0ve the gray axis fr0m the center t0ward N0rth-East, they are the even squares: 2 by 2, 4 by 4, 6 by 6, 8 by 8, and s0 f0rth running thr0ugh

67I

the numbers I44, I96, and 0n t0 a t0p c0mer 0ut 0f view at the number 40I in the r0th r0tati0n.

H0w d0 we use the Square 0f Nine?

Billy J0nes wr0te an artide entitled “0 t0 36O degrees — March 2I t0 March 20—A Cyde” in V0l. 4, N0.1, 0f “The W. D. Gann Technical Review,” dated January I98S.

In I976 1 went t0 Miami, Fl0rida... While there, 1 saw a picture 0f Mr. Gann sitting at his desk and up0n his desk was a m0del 0f a pyramid with the numbers, exactly like th0se 0n the Square 0f Nine, painted 0n the m0del...

Gann als0 had a large Square 0f Nine printed up0n a very 0ld papyrus substance that was framed and hanging 0n the wall. Many 0f y0u that have been in my 0ffice have seen this large 0riginal chart.

When 1 90t all the charts h0me in P0mer0y and started 90ing thr0ugh them, 1 f0und Gann had used the chart c0nsistently. There was 0ne f0r every c0mm0dity and st0ck he traded. They were in all sizes and c0n- structed f0r many different reas0ns...

The imp0rtant fact 1 have leamed fr0m the 0n90ing study 0f them is that actual market m0vements c0incide with the lay0ut 0f the charts’ TIME and DEGREE cyde 0f 36O...

Under the secti0n titled “Time and Price Resistance P0ints Acc0rding t0 Squares 0f Numbers” in W. D. Gann C0mm0dity C0urse, Mr. Gann wr0te that: “St0cks (and C0mm0dities) w0rk 0ut t0 the square 0f dif- ferent numbers, triangle p0ints 0f different numbers, the squares 0f their b0tt0ms, the squares 0f their t0ps, 0r t0 a halfway p0int 0f the different squares acc0rding t0 the time peri0d. Theref0re, it is imp0rtant f0r y0u t0 study the resistance levels acc0rding t0 these numbers. The squares 0f each number and the halfway p0int between the squares 0f 0ne number and the next p0int are very imp0rtant.

If y0u examine d0sely the numbers 0f the ‘Square 0f Nine’ 0r the 0dds

---

and evens chart, y0u find that these natural squares are aligned 0n the same angle fr0m the center. The even squares 0f 4, I6, 36, 64, 100, and s0 0n, 90 fr0m the center up t0 the t0p right-hand c0mer.

Since the distance fr0m I6 (the square 0f 4) t0 2S (the square 0f 5) is I8O degrees ar0und the chart, it bec0mes dear why Mr. Gann expected changes in the trend 0f a market price at I8O degrees 0r ‘0n an angle 0f I8O’. Similarly, he w0uld expect changes at 9O° (0ne-half 0f 0ne square) and 36O° (tw0 squares).

The square pr0gressi0n seems t0 w0rk better with three significant digits. [CB: Agreed.] If y0u are studying a market with f0ur digits in a price, try dr0pping the last number t0 get t0 a number y0u can use 0n the chart. [CB: D0n’t d0 this.] Similarly, if y0u are studying a l0w-priced st0ck, try adding a zer0 0r m0ve the decimal t0 get three significant digits.

The square 0f Nine is with0ut a d0ubt 0ne 0f Mr. Gann’s m0st p0werful trading and analysis t00ls. It als0 can be a little c0mplex.

Did y0u catch the references t0 midp0ints between the squares? Y0u cann0t find a midp0int 0f a square 0n a Sextile, and y0u cann0t d0 any calculati0ns when the numbers are n0t in a Square.

Billy J0nes said tw0 imp0rtant things: The Wheel w0rks best using three numbers. Recall the C0ffee Letter when Gann instructed t0 use the “D0llar Value.” 1 w0uld add three 0r f0ur numbers. Why? This is a l0garithmic calculat0r. The l0gs are t00 wide apart the d0ser y0u m0ve t0ward the center pin 0f the wheel. Stay in the middle t0 the 0utside 0f the Wheel.

Mr. J0nes als0 talks 0f dr0pping a significant digit. That’s a pr0blem f0r F0rex markets and we will l00k at this sh0rtly. But it brings t0 y0ur attenti0n the questi0n: H0w d0 we put a market price int0 the wheel that is n0t already a d0llar value? That questi0ns means we will als0 f0cus 0n c0nversi0ns and price units.

The infam0us U.5. Treasury B0nd Exercise. Infam0us because my students kn0w it well. This is f0r all the pe0ple wh0 have passed thr0ugh this exercise and f0r all wh0 are ab0ut t0 j0in their family. This is the exact exercise fr0m which they leamed.

1 had a L0nd0n Treasury B0nd Market-Maker call me 0ne day. He said, “1’ll pay f0r the c0urse, just give me the c0nversi0n f0r T-B0nds.” 1 explained 1 c0uld n0t because y0u had t0 understand why y0u are 90ing t0 use m0re than a price b0tt0m 0r t0p. Y0u need t0 understand the c0ncept 0f c0nfluence z0nes. He gr0aned. Said he w0uld fly 0ver fr0m L0nd0n. He t00k the dass and when he 90t h0me he had t0 hide his Gann Wheel as 1 used t0 give away the large $7OO Wheels 1 had purchased fr0m Nikki J0nes. He said he was deadly accurate t0 within f0ur ticks when a maj0r G0vemment Rep0rt sh0cked the B0nd market. The pr0blem f0r him was finding that he had t0 bring the Wheel int0 the 0ffice s0 that he c0uld calculate the new targets fr0m the reversal. F0r m0nths 0thers w0uld pass behind him humming the theme fr0m the Twilight-20ne. Let me sh0w y0u what he kn0ws.

Figure 29.I8 is a daily chart 0f the U.5. Treasury B0nd Futures market in May 0f I999. N0w 1 never changed the chart because the farther away we were fr0m I999, the m0re mem0rable that date became.

1 explained that the chart sh0ws a price l0w at 119/22 which is cirded. Here is h0w t0 use the Square 0f Nine.

First, there is a c0nversi0n step needed s0 a market trading in 32nds can be used with the Square 0f Nine Wheel.

Gann Wheel C0nversi0ns—T-B0nds—Starting Price @ 2I9/22

1. C0nvert the handle t0 32nds. 119 x 32 = 38O8

2. Add 22, the remainder, equals 3,830 t0tal units 0f 32nds

3. N0w subtract 20OO, equals I830. (Why c0mes later.)

4. Set the Wheel’s template 0° radian 0n 2830... (Figure 29.I9)

5. N0w m0ve d0ckwise because we want t0 find a resistance price. It will be a higher number than I830. F0ll0w the Wheel r0w t0 the b0tt0m left c0mer. Jump 0ver the square b0undary between the numbers I849 and I8SO. (Figure 29.20)

6. M0ve up the c0lumn tracking the incremental numbers until y0u arrive at the 4S° radian line that is c0nnected at the center pin. 4S° up fr0m I830 equals I8S3.

7. Next. Add back in t0 y0ur new price the 20OO we subtracted in step n0. 3. I8S3 + 20OO, equals 38S3

8. Divide 38S3 by 32 = I20.4O62S

9. R0und up t0 4 decimals, equals I20.4O63

IO. The I20 number is the new handle in 32nds, but n0w we need t0 c0nvert the decimal 0f.4O63 t0 32nds. Figure 29.I7 is my cheat sheet fixed t0 the underside 0f my m0use pad. (Hist0ry there, baby! Same laminated 0ne f0r nearly 30 years. 1’m n0t a B0nd trader, 0r it w0uld be in my head by n0w.)

11..4O63 equals I3/32

I2. Final target is stated as “I20/I3 is 4S° UP fr0m 119/22.”

Here’s the kicker, every single number we will read as an angle fr0m the I830 c0nversi0n starting number will back 0ut 0f the Wheel 0n a perfect 32nd!

Using the split Wheel in Figures 29.2I4 and 29.2Ib, 1 have cirded the numbers fr0m I830, 0ur piv0t price l0w at 119/22 in Chart 29.I8, thr0ugh a series 0f target prices.

4S° we just c0mpleted. S0 n0w we w0uld m0ve up the c0lumn until the 9O° radian cr0sses the next resistance price target, then I20°, I8O°, 24O°, 27O°, 315°, and a full r0tati0n at 36O°. 1 skipped 0ne 0f the 4S° angles at I35°. Why? 1 kn0w B0nds are a Trine market. The I20° angle is far m0re imp0rtant.

Using Figures 29.2Ia and 29.2Ib, we will c0ntinue d0ckwise t0 c0llect the 0ther numbers we need.

4S°, we just c0mpleted. 9O°, wheel n0. I873

I20°, wheel n0. I887

Skip the next angle, we m0ve t0 the right side 0f the Wheel in Figure 29.2Ib

I8O°, wheel n0. I9I7 Skip the next angle

24O°, wheel n0. I949 27O°, wheel n0. I96I 315°, wheel n0. I98S

and a full r0tati0n at 36O°, wheel n0. 20OS. The 36O° ‘UP’ target is always directly 0ne r0w higher fr0m where we set the starting price.

Every single angle pr0duces a target that is exact t0 the 32nd. Dr0p the mic. Take a b0w if y0u did it by hand! We calculated targets f0r resistance ab0ve the market. T0 find

N0w, the questi0ns. Can y0u m0ve the starting price int0 the middle 0f the calculat0r? N0. It is ab0ut aspect relati0nships, which are harm0nic intervals. We deliberately want t0 w0rk 0n the segment 0f the spiral that falls in this range in the middle 0r 0uter r0tati0ns 0f the wheel. If I830 were in the middle, 36O° w0uld read I833. S0, st0p d0ing this... a l0t 0f pe0ple are.

Is the c0nversi0n 20OO in this example still valid in t0day’s markets? B0nds are trading I42/OS as 1 am writing. N0w that’s a 900d questi0n. 1 was creating an excel spreadsheet as 1 realized b0nds traded ina fairly repeatable range. First, 1 th0ught great, create a r0w and c0py/paste the spreadsheet d0wn the rest 0f the page. N0. The l0garithmic fact0r as an expansi0n/ c0ntracti0n cyde ruins that slick idea. That is h0w 1 first leamed it was a spiral and had l0gs.

Then 1 disc0vered it takes ab0ut f0ur numbers, like I86O t0 I864 t0 m0ve 1/32. G00d, 1 can enter the spreadsheet wheel number and never d0 it again f0r that r0w. 1 can skip t0 every f0urth r0w. Great idea... that impl0ded. The G0vemment changed the c0up0n rate f0r the U.5. 30-year Treasury B0nd. My spreadsheet 0f f0ur years 0f calculati0ns blew up as it was n0t in the range 0f the new trading prices. Back t0 square 0ne. Pun intended.

Here’s where 1 am t0day. 1 have given this f0rmula t0 Market Analyst. It is a f0rmula ready t0 pl0t and use 0n y0ur chart. It w0rks perfectly in t0day’s markets f0r intraday 0r 2-3-day traders. Why intraday? This c0nversi0n gives price targets with a spread appr0- priate f0r these traders. Wider spread targets f0r l0nger h0riz0ns will be handled differently. We use the aspect rati0 0f the chart. L0ts 0f examples are c0ming, n0t t0 w0rry. But we are n0t d0ne with this part 0f the exercise.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

E. SQUARE OF NINE CONFLUENCE 2ONES IN U.5. TREASURY BONDS

Great! Y0u did it 0nce...n0w d0 it tw0 m0re times. Why? All the c0nventi0nal Gann f0lk will think that is the end 0f the dass. N0. Want t0 bl0w y0ur mind, ast0und y0ur dients, and c0ntr0l the risk? Keep 90ing! Create a c0nfluence target z0ne. 1 sat thr0ugh a vide0 a l0ng time a90 that went 0n f0rever ab0ut winding trails and wandering elephants, yawn, and it ended with a statement, “See h0w accurate this is?” Tw0 h0urs later he landed I6/32nds OVER the actual T-B0nd market price high. 1 am n0t impressed as a market that runs 0ver the target is expensive. Five hundred bucks a c0ntract 0ff; 1 d0n’t think s0.

S0, 1 began t0 apply my appr0ach 0f creating Fib0nacci c0nfluence t0 create Gann Wheel c0nfluence z0nes. This is what has been behind the frequent dient questi0n all these years, ‘H0w did y0u d0 that?!’ That is the reas0n 1 am kn0wn in this industry t0day—price target accuracy. 1 mean, lethal accuracy. 1 am passing it 0n t0 y0u. T0tal panic meltd0wns, melt-ups, v0lume driven markets 0r thin as Swiss Cheese markets, dients have seen the c0nfluence z0nes in the rep0rt st0p the market like a brick wall. 1 have tw0 decades public pr00f that y0u want t0 leam h0w t0 d0 this.

Back t0 the chart in Figure 29.I8 first.

In Figure 29.I8 we used the price l0w at 119/22.

There is a l0w at 119/O9. There is the start 0f an Elli0tt third wave. The price cirded is I20/22. Beside it is a handwritten ‘27.’ Back then the fl00r traders had rail watchers and had t0 c0rrect s0me trades that they had 0vertly been thieves ab0ut. The price was I20/27 and was c0rrected t0 I20/22. 1 used b0th f0r th0se needing extra h0mew0rk. Use the c0rrect price at I20/22.

---

29. Less0n Nine: Time/Price Charts—The Gann Wheels

There is a str0ng bar with a price l0w at I2I/27. Use it als0 asa start.

Y0u f0ll0w all the steps we passed thr0ugh in the step-by-step example the first time. 1 will put the Wheel numbers int0 the 0ld spreadsheet.

Here is what we get fr0m f0ur piv0ts in Figure 29.22.

Just a r0ugh cut and paste 0f the different starting price levels with their angle targets prices.

The 119/IO price in the table f0r 29.22 is 0ne tick 0ff the actual l0w at 119/O9 in Figure 29.I8. It d0es n0t matter—as 1 menti0ned y0u need ab0ut 4 ticks f0r the wheel t0 shift 1/32nd in this price range.

N0w the imp0rtant step. Pay attenti0n. Match up any targets fr0m DIFFERENT piv0ts that have similar prices—same step we d0 t0 create a Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne. (The Fib0nacci z0ne f0rms when different rati0s like 0.6I8 and 0.SO 0verlap.) The target in Figure 29.22 selects f0ur price targets, all 0n different angles, that fall within a tight band 0f price targets. The range falls fr0m I23/I3 (I23.4O63) t0 I23/2I (I23.6S63), a band width 0f 8/32nds. The market cann0t break ab0ve I23/2I. Often the c0nfluence z0ne that devel0ps is much tighter than this even in t0day’s trading range. The start was at 119/IO. In Figure 29.I8 y0u will find that the price high that ends the swing and t0ps the market... is I23/I9.

The market did n0t break the c0nfluence z0ne. See why L0nd0n Market-Makers are talking?

If y0u struggle with the wh0le idea 0f c0nfluence, 90 back t0 my b00k, Fib0nacci Analysis. The difference is that Gann starts 0n 0ne starting price and the 36O° target is defined simply by kn0wing the start. The 36O° target, 0r Octave, is the end 0f the range that is then subdivided int0 Gann’s harm0nic intervals. With Fib0nacci c0n- fluence z0nes, y0u must understand h0w t0 select the range fr0m

68I

beginning t0 end... making y0u smarter in everything else y0u d0 with Gann, such as fan angle placement and such fr0m str0ng bars and gaps, but n0t just GAPS, s0metimes just little gaps. We used the bar after a key reversal; we used third waves and the b0tt0m 0f f0urth waves. These are all the hidden milest0nes the markets use t0 build future relati0nships. They d0n’t change based 0n the meth0d being applied which may use harm0nic 0r ge0metric intervals.

N0w we need l0ts 0f chart examples and we can als0 tackle the questi0n ab0ut price units and c0nversi0n fact0rs.

D0 y0u have d0ubt ab0ut Gann’s views regarding the use 0f c0n- fluence? G00d! N0w 1 can pull my Ace 0ut 0f my sleeve. In Gann’s C0mm0dity c0urse, in the Master Egg C0urse, there is a chapter called, “The Master Square f0r Price and Time Trends 0n Eggs.” This entire less0n is ab0ut Gann’s Cirdes and a Triangle calculat0r that we will lightly l00k at in the next chapter. But, what 1’d like t0 share with y0u n0w is what Gann calls his “Nine Mathematic P0ints f0r Price Culminati0ns.” What is a culminati0n? Yes, a c0nfluence.

Nine Mathematic P0ints f0r Price Culminati0ns Gann wr0te:

1. Resistance levels made by market fluctuati0ns.

2. Natural Resistance levels in the squares and 36O-degree cirde.

3. Ge0metric angles.

4. Time cydes and time peri0ds.

5- Squaring 0ut price with time fr0m t0ps and b0tt0ms.

6. Odd and even squares and the half-way p0ints between 0dd and even squares.

F. PRICE FACTORS IN MULTIPLE GLOBAL MARKETS WITH SQUARE OF NINE CONFLUENCE 2ONES ON DECEMBER 6, 20I8

In this secti0n 1 will d0cument the markets 1 captured f0r y0u 0n De- cember 6, 20I8. Pay attenti0n, because 1 cann0t tell y0u the number 0f trades 1 had t0 let pass by because 1 knew 1 had t0 capture the event and keep pushing f0rward t0 write, s0 1 c0uld meet my self-imp0sed deadline 0f December 2I t0 2S, 20I8. That is 0ur Gann Time Fact0r and these charts sh0w why 1 want t0 bec0me a trader again!

Many students have t0ld me that the m0st helpful appr0ach t0 leam was the walk-thr0ugh 0f my current w0rking charts. W0rking charts means the 0nes 1 am using t0 track markets f0r dients and t0 d0 all my analysis w0rk in preparati0n f0r trading. 1 have n0t rem0ved anything in these charts. N0 need as n0thing 1 use was hidden fr0m y0u and n0w y0u have the backgr0und needed t0 study these charts at y0ur 0wn pace. Squares 0f ranges, fan angles in m0st cases, and harm0nic w0rk are 0ften d0ne 0n separate charts beside the 0nes y0u will see.

Time Fact0rs f0ll0wed by accurate price targets fr0m c0nfluence z0nes c0me first and sec0nd f0r me. 1 use all the 0ther meth0ds as my way 0f understanding what will happen when the market arrives at the c0nfluence z0nes at specific time cyde dusters. L0ts 0f markets and examples as s0me p0se s0me issues y0u need t0 kn0w h0w t0 handle. Okay, let’s get started.

FIGURE 29.23. China Shanghai C0mp0site 3-day Chart—w0rking real-time chart f0r December 6, 20I8—T w0 Square 0f Nine pr0- jecti0ns, PRICE UNIT = 3.6

Tw0 sets 0f Square 0f Nine targets. Set very early in the m0ve, as was the Elli0tt Wave c0unt. ‘SI’ truncates the key reversal and was set bef0re 1 knew it w0uld bec0me a str0ng dedining bar. It was just a questi0n 0f eliminating the key reversal. ‘S2’ is the sec0nd Square 0f Nine pr0jecti0n d0wn. It was started at the t0p 0f the swing that f0r me was the end 0f wave (2) up, because it was a zigzag pattem. That high l00ks like a c0nfluence z0ne. It is n0t, because 0ne line is the 4S° target fr0m ‘SI’ and the 0ther line is the start 0f the sec0nd Square 0f Nine series.

The Shanghai has been tracking the Gann Square 0f Nine c0n- fluence z0nes all the way d0wn. The price l0w is marked wave (3). 1 kn0w this is n0t the end 0f the dedining swing. H0w? Elli0tt Wave structure. M0re imp0rtant is the Time Fact0r duster near the end 0f the year. The cyde we just b0unced up int0 is a min0r time cyde. The C0mp0site Index is in a weak p0siti0n. One m0re dr0p int0 the b0tt0m 0f wave (3) w0uld 0nly be part 0f wave (4) up. Slightly l0wer and expect a wave ‘C’ 0f (4) rally back t0 the gap. H0w d0 we kn0w?

What d0es the l0nger h0riz0n chart l00k like f0r H0ng K0ng? Which market leads the Shanghai? Yes, Australia. What d0es the analysis give us there? Let’s say n0thing else helps. Add the Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0nes and determine which 0f these tw0 Gann targets within the Shanghai will als0 have a Fib0nacci c0n- fluence z0ne. Only 0ne Gann c0nfluence z0ne will likely merge at the target in b0th meth0ds.

What ab0ut 0ur Fan Angles? Y0u need them 0n b0th the Shanghai and Hang Seng. The price unit used f0r the Square 0f Nine was 3.6. Just l00k t0 the b0tt0m right 0f any chart. Everything applied as a Gann t00l uses price unit 3.6 in this chart t0 keep the 4S° angle true.

FIGURE 29.24a. DJIA Futures December 20I8—60-minutes De- cember 6, 20I8, I2:28 A.M. (update t0 Figure 28.I2. DJIA N0vember 28, 20I8).

The chart in Figure 29.24a is the chart p0sted 0nline f0r dients in my evening rep0rt very late that night. (S0rry, this is what 1 was d0ing behind the scenes. But much 0f this descripti0n was just transferred 0ver t0 the rep0rt.) This 6O-minute chart f0r the DJIA futures c0ntract YMI82 b0unced between tw0 Square 0f Nine supp0rt/resistance levels, then dr0pped hard t0 the 0ne under the market. The spike d0wn in this chart dr0pped s0 hard t0day that it slipped thr0ugh the c0nfluence z0ne at 24,694. Is this a pr0blem? The DJIA is trying t0 stabilize ab0ve the current c0nfluence supp0rt z0ne under the current bar. The spike d0wn thr0ugh the c0nfluence z0ne n0w serving as supp0rt is what Gann called l0st m0ti0n. 1 d0

n0t view it this way. The spike d0wn thr0ugh the Gann target fell t0 a Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne. N0tice the aspect just t0 the right 0f the current price bar? The cyde c0mes in t0day’s sessi0n (it is the wee h0urs 0f the m0ming here), and we kn0w the dedine was inc0mplete. That nearby appr0aching time fact0r is expected t0 start a m0ve t0 the target marked by the black arr0w 0n the b0tt0m where a 315° and 27O° Square 0f Nine c0nfluence z0ne is dustered. The target is 24,I99 t0 24,26O. Why that level? The lines ab0ve this z0ne under the market are n0t c0nfluence. The first maj0r target is the 0ne at 24,I99 t0 24,26O. This market is 90ing t0 seek the next c0n- fluence z0ne due t0 the strength 0f the m0ve. Plus, the maj0r Time Fact0rs d0n’t c0me in until the end 0f the year. We are t00 early. H0w can the market ‘kill time’ as we have an0ther three weeks t0 define a b0tt0m? This is where Elli0tt helps. Let’s say t0day’s cyde marks the end 0f the current c0ns0lidati0n. A wave ‘c’ rally w0uld run t0 the new M00n cyde marked in Figure 29.24a. We c0uld t0p int0 the New M00n phase and then dr0p t0wards the target. One 0f the reas0ns this idea has merit is in the C0mp0site Index. It is n0t ata m0mentum high n0r diverging fr0m a m0mentum 0s- cillat0r high; it is r0lling up fr0m the b0tt0m 0f the screen. That means y0u have t0 check the daily chart t0 see if it has a similar p0siti0n in the C0mp0site. If ‘yes’, the market is 0ut f0r bl00d 0n the sh0rts until the excess pressure and 0vers0ld c0nditi0n is re- lieved. The market w0uld target a c0nfluence z0ne that has a Gann angle bisecting it. D0 n0t 0verl00k the ‘v0id’ between 24,694 and 26,798. That spread with n0 resistance means a fast market. There is s0mething else ab0ut the target z0ne 0n the b0tt0m. It is where a Fib0nacci c0nfluence z0ne 0verlaps the Gann c0nfluence z0ne. That target is a brick wall.

It is n0w 8:OO p.m. after the trading sessi0n d0sed t0day... and after dinner, we see what happened. The market spiked d0wn, and the c0nfluence z0ne held at the t0p 0f the Gann c0nfluence z0ne in the chart that we discussed. The evening bef0re the DJIA was at 24,7O3. The market fell t0 the target z0ne at 24,26O. That is a big m0ve f0r this market. But it then reversed and the sharp reb0und back up is thr0ugh the first c0nfluence z0ne 0f resistance and aiming f0r the sec0nd c0nfluence z0ne just ab0ve the market. S0 glad this happened t0day! This is why we d0 the extra w0rk t0 create Gann Square 0f Nine c0nfluence z0nes. This happens all the time and will give y0u the c0nfidence y0u are d0ing it c0r- rectly. The New M00n may well end wave ‘c’ up 0f a f0urth wave. Danger0us Time Fact0r t0 start new trends. In this case resume the d0minant trend d0wn. What d0es that mean? We hit b0th targets t0day, but the price acti0n int0 the dedine means m0re t0 the d0wnside t0 c0me. The swing fr0m the cyde t0day int0 the price l0w is a blatantly dear three-wave structure. That means ‘b’ d0wn f0ll0wed by ‘c’ up. That means the next z0ne at 23,9S4 t0 24,OI4 c0mes next fr0m 2S,O26 0r 2S,I93 and the New M00n c0uld be the cyde beat at which everything we saw t0day unwinds. (Target is in. the chart f0r a t0p at the Gann c0nfluence z0ne just 0ver the market n0w.) The z0ne under the 0ne we slammed int0 t0day c0ntains a 36O° and 27O° target area. The 36O° level is extremely imp0rtant being the ‘36O’. We c0uld track this all week... but Ineed t0 rec0rd 0ther markets 0f interest t0 readers in different ge0graphic regi0ns.

N0w we jump 0ver t0 Eur0pe. Oh br0ther, d0n’t fail me n0w as much rides 0n this chart. Y0u see the wave c0unt 1 have been w0rking thr0ugh f0r dients has been in the chart f0r a l0ng time int0 the highs and dedine. 1 debated rem0ving the Elli0tt but decided n0t t0 because it is an h0nest view and the c0mplete w0rking chart sh0wing h0w 1 was thinking ab0ut this market at this time. 1 think this is all wave C 0f (4) d0wn; it implies that 20I9 will have a fifth wave up bef0re the real bear market bites every0ne in the butt.

‘Start 1’ is 0n the high. Why? It was started at the high when 1 had n0 0ther 0pti0n. It was a perfect wave c0unt t0 end the expanded flat rally C 0f (B) up. Then the market respected the Square 0f Nine h0riz0ntal 4S° price target as resistance twice; 1 had t0 leave it. 1 then added the sec0nd Square 0f 9 series d0wn fr0m ‘Start 2’.

The black arr0w the market is testing n0w with a p0ssible d0uble b0tt0m is the target t0 end wave 3 0f (C) d0wn. M0st likely w0rking wave 4 up within (C) d0wn n0w means the target at the l0wer black arr0w is a p0ssible final target f0r this entire c0rrecti0n. L00k left. The black 0val cirdes highlight the values that defined the c0n- fluence z0ne. They c0ntain a 4S° target at 48IO and a 36O° target. MAJOR when 36O appears in the c0nfluence z0ne.

D0 y0u see the ‘36O° Time Fact0r just t0 the right? If the French CAC can dr0p t0 0ne 0f the Gann c0nfluence z0nes marked by black arr0ws p0inting t0 the left, AND 0n that 36O° cyde... it sh0uld be a maj0r swing up because the entire m0ve is dearly an Expanded Flat.

Irish St0ck Exchange—m0nthly—w0rking real-time chart f0r December 6, 20I8 Square 0f Nine pr0jecti0n fr0m July 1, 20O7, Fib0nacci C0nfluence Created fr0m a start date September 20I8 t0 February 20I3, and fr0m September 20I8 t0 Oct0ber 1, 2011, Market dedine inc0mplete, PRICE UNIT = 9O.

The Irish St0ck Market will dem0nstrate the BIG err0r pe0ple make when they create c0nfluence z0nes. 1 mean BIG. D0n’t d0 this. It was given its 0wn chapter in Chapter 3. Then in Chapter 4 T intr0duced Fib0nacci and Square 0f 9 c0nfluence z0nes.

The trap is in Figure 29.28, the market dedine int0 20O9 t0 the far left, that was f0ll0wed by a near full retracement. Y0u may n0t use ANY 0f the bars that have been retraced behind the rec0very rally. Why? The market c0uld be rescaling. This chart sh0ws Fi- b0nacci c0nfluence and a single Square 0f Nine pr0jecti0n. All the starting p0ints have been made fr0m bars in the rally after the 20O9 l0w. The market is dearly n0t 0n maj0r supp0rt just yet. We have a gr0wing picture that keeps repeating.

1 did n0t spend much time t0 research aspects f0r the Irish St0ck Exchange. Clearly the Neptune retr0grade is 0ne y0u want in y0ur charts.

This chart has been ar0und in my c0mputer unt0uched f0r a l0ng time. P00r Greece, we will all hear that they are ab0ut t0 default again. Maybe n0t 20I9, but itis c0ming. This chart was t0 determine a target f0r a price high t0 end wave (C) up. The tw0 heavy black lines were in the rep0rts sent t0 dients. It was c0rrect. N0w that Greece’s Index has br0ken the start 0f the Fib0nacci level marked ‘F, everything w0uld have t0 be deleted and y0u w0uld start anew. ‘F’ started the Fib0nacci retracements, and ‘Fi’ and ‘F2’ marked the end 0f the Fib0nacci ranges t0 be subdivided.

When we were in 20IO, 2011, 1 have l0st track, when the w0rld was watching Greece impl0de and f0cus als0 tumed t0 Spain un- c0upling fr0m the EUR, 1 watched the Spain IBEX 35 m0re 0ften. 1 just realized that 1 did n0t put a chart in f0r y0u in this series as 1 was ‘fried’. But this will help. Kn0w that 1 use a 3-week IBEX 35 chart with the f0ll0wing aspects. That will make up f0r the missing chart... 1 h0pe. (1 want t0 still be all0wed back t0 Barcel0na!)

time, the subtler, ‘cap’ as a whisper can be far m0re meaningful as far as understanding price harm0nics within a m0ve. The 0thers are dearly str0ng bars. Why did 1 skip the swing l0w ab0ve ‘F3’? St0p thinking swings! Read the price acti0n. Str0ng bars and gaps are much m0re imp0rtant than that ch0ppy swing l0w. Plus, the c0nfluence z0nes that f0rmed fr0m the different Fib0nacci rati0s tell me 1 have selected the c0rrect piv0ts t0 use.

The Nifty is driven by 0verly em0ti0nal traders that p0siti0n 0n ‘h0pe’. The thing t0 watch f0r is when Nifty takes 0ff like a scared rabbit and the tw0 menti0ned c0mparis0n markets have a sl0wer, weaker, 0r w0rse extreme divergent m0ve relative the Nifty. Always a heads-up waming.

29. Less0n Nine: Time/Price Charts—The Gann Wheels 7OS

G. WHEEL FORMULAE

One questi0n that c0mes in 0ccasi0nally is a reader asks me whether the c0nversi0n 1 gave in Technical Analysis f0r the Trading Pr0fessi0nal f0r the 5&PSOO is c0rrect. It was c0rrect f0r the range the 5&PSOO futures were trading in 20O9. That is a l0ng way away fr0m where we are t0day. N0w it is easier due t0 s0ftware changes, but the general questi0n ab0ut c0nversi0ns and f0rmulas remains. We want t0 stay in the middle 0r 0uter secti0ns 0f the Square 0f Nine Wheel.

Remember that pesky f0rmula Price = Time’, the 0ne m0st 0f India is using inc0rrectly as a means t0 Square the Range? Finally! We need it n0w.

Here are a few examples:

Square 0f Nine

Price 1 fr0m I44 t0 36O°...

P2 = (Time plus degrees 0f r0tati0n divided by I8O)? P2 = (I2 + 36O/I8O)? = I96, same as wheel

Price 1 fr0m I44 t0 I8O°...

P2 = (I2 + I8O/I8O) = I3? = I69 (wheel is between I68 and I69) P2 = (I2 + 9O/I8O) = I2.5? = 156 (9O degrees 0n the wheel is 156) Pa = (I2 + I20/I8O) = I2.677 = I6O.S2.

Trine 0n a physical Square 0f Nine wheel is I6I% —c0rrect.

Hexa90n Wheel Price 1 is I44

Find Price2 — Using Price = Time? P2 = (Time plus degrees 0f r0tati0n divided by I8O)? Pricer fr0m I44 t0 36O°...

Pricer fr0m I44 t0 I8O°... P2 = (I2 + 15I.2/I8O) = I2.84? = I6S

P2 = (I2 + 42/36O)

36O/42 = 8.S7 X 2I = I8O 0r I8O/2I

42 = number 0f increments 0n the 7th ring. I68 — I26 = 42 (number in pri0r ring)

RING 7... I44 plus 2I = I6S at I8O degrees—c0rrect.

Ring increments are 6, I8, 36, G0, 9O, I26, I68, 2I6, I68, 2I6

I26 —9O = 36 9O-6O = 30 6O ~ 36 = 24 36-I8 = I8 I8-6 = I2

Fact0r 0f 6 t0 each r0w. (Add 6 t0 the pri0r rings number 0f incremental steps.)

7th r0w is 7 x 6 = 42

8th r0w 8 x 6 = 48 incremental steps

I8O° plus 36O = I44 plus 2I (the I8O°) plus 48 (42 + 6 next r0w) = 2I3 7th r0w is 7 X 6 = 42

Angles in each r0w 36O/42 = 8.7I X 2I = I8O°

42/3 = I4

244 plus I4 = 158... I20° up —c0rrect! (c0mpared t0 the Hex Wheel)

Price pr0bably has t0 be n0rmalized t0 a range 0f 100 t0 999. Price = Time? is a wheel calculati0n!

N0w a new pr0blem. This appr0ach cann0t be used f0r a c0mputer

applicati0n because it d0es n0t kn0w the angle. Y0u have t0 kn0w the ring value and use a multiplier 0f the square r00t f0rmula. Use

1.333. B0th f0rmulas f0r the Hexa90n and the Square 0f Nine have a SORT c0mp0nent.

The Square 0f Nine uses the f0ll0wing f0rmula f0r the f0ll0wing angles listed. Cell ($B4) is the price that starts the r0tati0n ar0und the Wheel.

Angle 4S = ((SQRT($B4)) +0.2S) x (SQRT($B4) + 0.2S) Angle 9O = ((SQRT($B4)) + 0.5) x (SQRT($B4) + 0.5) Angle I20 = ((SQRT($B4)) + 0.67) x (SQRT($B4) + 0.67) Angle I8O = ((SQRT($B4)) + 1) x (SQRT($B4) + 1) Angle 24O = ((SQRT($B4)) + 1.37) x (SQRT($B4) + 1.37) Angle 27O = ((SQRT($B4)) + 1.5) x (SQRT($B4) + 1.5) Angle 315 = ((SQRT($B4)) + 1.7S) x (SQRT($B4) + 1.7S) Angle 36O = ((SQRT($B4)) + 2) x (SQRT($B4) + 2)

H. PYTHAGOREAN OVERLAY

The Pytha90rean 0verlay 0f Perfect Fifths and Perfect F0urths was intr0duced in Figure IO.I9. Then in Chapter 26 in “Overlay Har- m0nics” we c0vered the descripti0n 0f this imp0rtant 0verlay but deferred the setup until we studied the Wheels in m0re detail. The Optuma s0ftware f0r the Wheels was being redesigned as this b00k was being written. We can n0w take a l00k at the setup requirements, as the Beta test has just squeaked in under the Christmas deadline t0 make it int0 the b00k. Okay, using the newly designed Hexa90n Wheel in the Optuma s0ftware, here we 90. In summary, the Py- tha90rean divisi0n 0f the cirde s0 that it is a calculat0r 0f Perfect Fifths and Perfect F0urths must have subdivisi0ns 0n the f0ll0wing angles: 0°, 24°, 4S°, 72°, 9O°, I20°, I44°, I8O°, 2I6°, 24O°, 28O°, 315°, and back t0 36O°.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

Figure 29.35 displays the new and far m0re precise Hexa90n Wheel. The Wheel is subdivided by the angles 0f the Pytha90rean harm0nic scale. N0tice the numbers increase by 0ne in a c0unterd0ckwise di- recti0n. Theref0re, the 0verlay must als0 have angles 24°, 4S°, 72°, and s0 f0rth pr0gress in a c0unterd0ckwise directi0n. The 0uter date ring must pr0gress in a c0unterd0ckwise directi0n as will the angle ring and planet ephemeris ring.

Figure 29.36 dem0nstrates h0w t0 use the Pr0perties wind0w t0 create the Pytha90rean 0verlay. The p0p-0ut frame 0f selecti0ns begins with a c0lumn 0f x’s. This all0ws y0u t0 delete a r0w if needed. The next c0lumn 0f check marks means y0u want this angle displayed 0n the wheel. Uncheck the b0x when y0u d0 n0t want that angle 0n the wheel. The third c0lumn displays a list with a label in each b0x 0f degrees. Be very careful here. One will have a default that sh0ws days. The 0ne angle marked days is t0 sh0w y0u that there are ad- diti0nal 0pti0ns. But y0u sh0uld change it as sh0wn in Figure 29.36 s0 all are set t0 use degrees t0 create the Pytha90rean 0verlay. The next c0lumn sh0ws the degrees 1 added by dicking the ‘+’ 0ver the x’s c0lumn. Add the degrees in the c0rrect 0rder. In the next c0lumn y0u will have t0 change the directi0n setting t0 C0unterd0ckwise. The c0lumn set t0 Se/ecti0n means the angles will be calculated fr0m the p0siti0n y0u selected within the Wheel. The far-right c0lumn will let us select the c0l0r we want drawn f0r that specific angle 0n the Hexa90n Wheel.

Figure 29.35 0ffers an imp0rtant review. The price 1 selected was 2I6. The next number 2I7 will jump t0 the next 0uter ring and t0 the left. A price target at 24° falls 0n 2I9%. As we m0ve c0unter- d0ckwise t0 find the next price level f0r resistance at 4S°, the angle cr0sses 2227%4. We find 9O° up at 227 fr0m the starting price at 2I6.

The price target is c0rrect. But there is a pr0blem. Take a m0ment t0 l00k at 227 and the astr0l0gical planet glyph. The wheel is telling us that 0n Christmas Day 0f 20I8 at I2 p.m. the planet Venus is stati0ned at 227°. N0w use this t0 check the ephemeris ring 0f the wheel. It is the third ring c0unting inwards. If 1 put my curs0r 0n the Venus Glyph in the ephemeris ring it will c0rrectly sh0w a label that Venus is transiting the angle 227.9. But the sec0nd inner ring will visually align Venus t0 a dial reading near 47°. What is wr0ng?

In the pr0perties wind0w is an0ther setting called Wheels. It is sh0wn in Figure 29.37. When the wheel settings are displayed we find that the Planets ring is set t0 start at West. This is Aries 0°. The setting y0u use will depend 0n y0ur applicati0n. 1 am n0t an astr0l0ger and prefer t0 see the ephemeris ring and angle ring track fr0m the selected price. Theref0re, 1 w0uld change this current setting f0r Planets fr0m West t0 Selecti0n. N0w 1 can easily see 0n the wheel itself that Venus is at 227° 0r I7° Sc0rpi0 because the ephemeris planet placement and angle dial can be read next t0 0ne an0ther.

Retum t0 Figure 29.35 t0 find where a target 0f 36O° fr0m 2I7 is l0cated. Is the c0rrect answer 27O 0r is it 27I? The c0rrect answer is 27O.

N0w this is why we did n0t address the Pytha90rean 0verlay in greater detail earlier in Chapter 26. H0w d0 we use this 0verlay t0 l0cate targets f0r supp0rt prices? D0 n0t change the prices within the Hexa90n Wheel fr0m c0unterd0ckwise. Invert the 0verlay. The first angle sh0uld be 24° in a descending number sequence. Y0u w0uld use this price scale and read the targets d0ckwise with a d0ckwise direc- ti0nal 0verlay. Why? The Pytha90rean intervals have six intervals fr0m 0° t0 I8O° and f0ur intervals between I8O° and 36O°. N0 0ther

0verlay y0u apply t0 either the Hexa90n Wheel 0r Square 0f Nine will enc0unter this because the 0ther 0verlays are mirr0r images 0n either side 0f I8O°.

1. GANN’5 “DOLLAR VALUE”

Gann’s “D0llar Value” that we leamed ab0ut fr0m his C0ffee Letter can be handy f0r s0me markets, but it is n0t as straightf0rward as it first appears.

Here are a few examples. H0wever, 1 believe the screen rati0, as described thr0ugh0ut these chapters, is a far better and m0re accurate meth0d f0r the Wheel when w0rking with charts 0n y0ur c0mputer screen.

C0m trading 3.8S%. The starting piv0t w0uld be between 38S and 386.

S0ybean Oil 28.69, set the start 0n 287, y0u r0und the f0urth number up and multiply by IO.

Feeder Cattle I44.47S, use I44 and halfway t0 I4S.

C0tt0n 78.S2, use 78S.

Currency example... Japanese Yen 112.6IO use 1126. EURUSD 1.I4I35, use 114I and just shy 0f the halfway sp0t between 114I and 1142. Currencies sh0uld use f0ur digits. Y0u may recall that this was a rec0mmendati0n by Billy J0nes. In my experience it is the c0rrect applicati0n f0r the F0rex markets. S0me traders take the square r00t 0f the last f0ur numbers after the decimal, which is n0t as c0nsistently accurate. Yes, y0u will hit it right 0n s0metimes... but which time? C0nsider making the change.

The redesigned Gann Wheels in Optuma will make it easy f0r us t0 find l0ngitude and specific z0diac alignments. Th0se wh0 d0 manual calculati0ns can use the table 0f c0nversi0ns in the Appendix L.

CHAPTER 30

Less0n Ten: The Master Egg C0urse—The Cirde and Triangle Calculat0rs

Gann t00k f0undati0nal c0ncepts and applied variati0ns as necessary t0 suit his needs. When y0u understand the Hexa90n, Tables, and Square 0f Nine, it is as if the Cirde and Triangle Charts were pre- curs0r devel0pments t0 the m0re refined Hex and Square calculat0rs.

The Cirde Chart is dearly an ephemeris, and 1 will sh0w y0u h0w it ev0lved. In Figure 30.1 is Gann’s Ephemeris Chart f0r Eggs c0m- paring May 28, I932; Sept IO, I947; and December 9, I9S2. Take n0tice 0f the entry “Oct0ber Eggs—I932 May 28 L0w 15OO.” Figure 30.2 can duplicate Gann’s inner wheel ephemeris f0r the market l0w 0n May 28, I932.

In Figure 30.2 the inner wheel....... Gann’s inner wheel in Figure 30.1 Uranus stati0ned 2I° Aries S6’...... Uranus stati0ned 2I° Aries S6’ Mars I2° Taurus O4’............4. Mars I2° Taurus O2’

There is n0 questi0n that the ring with the z0diac labels c0ntains the ephemeris stati0ns f0r the planets 0n May 28, I932 when Eggs made the price l0w at 15OO.

Then y0u have t0 study 30.1 very d0sely. L00k 0utside the ring 0n

the Aquarius sect0r. Gann wr0te “I9S2 Dec 9.” Bel0w this he wr0te “I947 Sept IO.” The easiest way t0 see h0w Gann is mapping these tw0 dates is t0 l00k at Taurus where Jupiter is n0ted twice. It reads Jupiter I2° Taurus x’ (I4’?) and Jupiter I6° Taurus 34’.

In Figure 30.2 1 have pl0tted a dual wheel. On December 9, I9S2 Jupiter is stati0ned at I2° Taurus IO’ Retr0grade. N0 questi0n Gann is mapping “I9S2 December 9 and I947 September IO” 0n the 0utside 0f his ephemeris. The key dates are listed in Gann’s chart 0n the b0tt0m left in Figure 30.1. The market l0w is the natal stati0n and Gann is making the c0mparis0n t0 the market high which he rec0rds 0n the b0tt0m left f0r I947 September IO—high S8SS and the price l0w f0r Eggs at 3720 0n I9S2 December 9. The dates are dearly marked. Y0u are 90ing t0 find a waxing 0pp0siti0n and a waning c0njuncti0n between the market l0w and a price high. In Gann’s chart we can see Jupiter and Neptune stati0ns c0mpared—the p0int being that we can see what Gann is d0ing in this Eggs Ephemeris Chart.

A key was given t0 us when Gann wr0te:

Example: The range in fluctuati0ns and the life 0f the present 0pti0n (c0ntract) 0f Oct0ber Eggs is 448S l0w and SO2S high, making a range 0f S4O p0ints. Subtract 36O fr0m S4O and we have the balance 0f I8O. This means that the market had advanced 1% cirdes 0r cydes and was at I8O-degree angle 0n May 3, I949. The writer s0ld Oct0ber Eggs at s0rs 0n May 3, I949. (Master Egg C0urse, p. 3.)

30. Less0n Ten: The Master Egg C0urse—The Cirde and Triangle Calculat0rs

Gann was describing the Cirde Chart.

Figure 30.3 is a Cirde Chart. It is dearly subdivided by 15° l0n- gitude divisi0ns. It can be used t0 c0unt degrees 0r days in increments 0f 15 as the chart label defines. Gann sh0ws natural dates and als0 h0urly increments. The cirde is theref0re subdivided int0 units 0f 24 t0 acc0mm0date the 15° l0ngitude subdivisi0ns.

Figure 30.4 is a different Cirde Chart, but it is als0 subdivided int0 15° l0ngitudes, dates, and h0urs that w0uld require a cirde 0f 24 sub- divisi0ns. The Cirde Charts 0f I2 have 30° l0ngitude subdivisi0ns. Pe0ple using these Wheels are f0cused 0n l0ngitude relati0nships t0 price. When the incremental numbers increase at a faster rate, the Cirde Chart will emulate the vibrati0ns f0r that specific market and trading tic values. The cirdes 0f 24 and I2 are astr0n0mical ephemeris calculat0rs.

Figure 30.5 is a d0uble entry calculat0r 0n a Square 0f F0ur. It sh0uld be called a balancing p0int table. N0tice the numbers 0n the t0p 0f each square are all even and increase by +I2 f0r markets that trade in 1/8 and 1/4s. The numbers in the r0w under these even values increase by +1. This is why 1 think these charts came bef0re the Hexa90n and Square 0f Nine. Gann has taken the Cirde Chart 0f I2 and c0nverted it int0 a table. The numbers that increase by 0ne are angles and l0ngitude increments. The Hexa90n and Square 0f Nine are m0re advanced. In terms 0f h0w Figure 30.5 c0uld be used, c0nsider a balancing p0int at I8O° al0ng the entire East axis. N0tice Gann has cirded the sec0nd r0w ab0ve the East axis with single numbers under the even set ab0ve. The numbers 9, 2S, 49, 8I, I2I, I69 are the 0dd squares f0r 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, I3.

If a market m0ved 972 units and traded in units 0f I2, it w0uld have m0ved 8I tics. If I2, 0r 0ne tic, equals 1° l0ngitude, we w0uld

7I3 calculate a balance p0int with the M00n that has transit + 8I° L0n- gitude 0n a price gain 0f 972 (0r 9.72 price units), 0r a gain 0f 8I tics. It is s0 much easier t0 use the Hexa90n and Square 0f Nine t0 make these calculati0ns. But all these values in Figure 30.4 0ffer cr0ss- references in this manner.

There is 0ne 0ther difference t0 p0int 0ut. Figure 30.3 sh0ws Time in h0urs m0ving c0unterd0ckwise fr0m Midnight 0n the S0uth radian. In Figure 30.4 Midnight is again 0n the S0uth axis, but the h0urs m0ve d0ckwise. Why? The numbers increase d0ckwise in Figure 30.3, but track c0unterd0ckwise in Gann’s Cirde Chart in Figure 30.4—an im- p0rtant 0bservati0n. 1 made 0ne change in Figure 30.4 fr0m Gann’s 0riginal, full cirde, which n0 0ne can read. After z00ming int0 the SE quarter, 1 c0py/pasted the chart title, “Master 36O° Chart” ab0ve his b0tt0m right label.

Gann had m0re than 0ne “Master 36O° Cirde Chart.” One chart that has increments 0f 5, as seen in Figure 30.6, he used f0r his descripti0n 0f supp0rt/resistance targets f0r Eggs. An0ther Cirde Chart has in- crements 0f 15 that w0uld be m0re suited f0r astr0n0mical balancing as we see in Figure 30.7.

The chart is in the c0urse. The angles described as imp0rtant are c0nsistent with 0verlays we have already used.

On the first page 0f “The Master Square f0r Price and Time Trends 0n Eggs,” Gann wr0te, “Beginning with the square at 15OO, the l0west price f0r Oct0ber Eggs, the highest price 0f S8SS c0mes 0ut in the square 0f 30 at 87I, but starting the square at zer0, S8SS c0mes 0ut in the square 0f 36, which ends at I296, and S8SS is at 116I in the square 0f 35, and 15 p0ints bel0w the 4S degree angle 0n May 5.”

1 c0uld n0t see this until 1 c0nverted the cirde int0 a square. If that

paragraph sends y0u squirrelly, y0u are n0t al0ne. But Gann d0es make 0ne interesting c0mment earlier when he says that I20 and 24O are imp0rtant angles. He is telling us that Eggs are a Trine market. In Figure 30.6 with a price l0w 0f 15OO, the price high 0f S8SS falls 0ne tic 0ff I20 degrees in Figure 30.6.

Gann als0 wr0te that “the l0ngitude 0f price was 0n the 6O° line.” Then it dawned 0n me that Gann was using tw0 Cirde Charts. Thanks a l0t f0r that 0ne. In Figure 30.7 the chart has increments 0f 15, n0t 5, and the price 15OO is 0n the 6O° line. Did he really d0 this all the time? Heck n0.

T0 begin Gann made an interesting c0mment 0n page 3 0f the Eggs C0urse:

Since the fluctuati0n 0f Eggs 0n the minimum 0f 5 p0ints, n0w equals $7.20 which is tw0 cirdes 0f 36O°, 0ne-half 0f this is 36O° and makes an angle m0ving at the rate 0f 2’ p0ints per day very imp0rtant. The fluctuati0ns will n0w w0rk better t0 the cirde 0f 36O°. In a few days 1 will send y0u an0ther Master Chart sh0wing each 15° 0f the resistance levels which will help y0u t0 determine resistance and tuming p0ints.

The Cirde gave birth t0 the Square as Gann c0uld calculate b0th at the same time. Figure 30.8 was first intr0duced t0 y0u in Figure 20.I7 when we l00ked at the big picture f0r Gann’s cydes. The squares are far m0re efficient calculat0rs. The d0uble entry tables serve a dual purp0se 0n 0ne page.

Thinking ab0ut the Cirde Chart helps us with the Triangle Chart.

The Triangle Chart is a Hexa90n subdivided 0n 15° and 30° l0n- gitudes. In Figure 30.9 the chart begins fr0m the price l0w at 30O in C0ffee that traded 0n Oct0ber 2, I936. This l0w was menti0ned in the C0ffee Letter which we analyzed earlier. But the Triangle chart

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

cann0t be used f0r 0ther markets and d0es n0t have the flexibility 0f the final f0rm Gann devel0ped, the Hexa90n.

Gann used different incremental units based 0n the tic value 0f the market being graphed. In Figure 30.9 we find that the increment is +30 f0r each entry.

Y0u may have t0 l00k very d0sely, but a thin hand-drawn line in the middle 0f the triangle chart passes thr0ugh the middle number c0lumn 0f the triangle. This c0lumn and the numbers that fall 0n either side 0n the 0utside edges 0f the triangle are the maj0r targets and n0ted cydes. While 1 understand and use a Hexa90n, 1 d0 n0t use this f0rmat f0r any 0f my markets. It is undear t0 me h0w it is used f0r Time analysis if y0u must c0nstantly r0tate thr0ugh each r0w. Ugh. H0wever, the partial Hexa90n c0uld be used similarly t0 calculate tum relati0nships within a range. N0tice Gann d0es n0t c0mplete r0w 2S in Figure 30.9. The calculati0ns being made are f0r the range, as Gann described in Eggs. This time the range is 30O t0 9630. B0th the Cirde and Triangle are awkward in my 0pini0n. But it’s imp0rtant t0 see h0w his calculat0rs may have ev0lved.

Gann’s charts that are used with a specific market with the hist0ric c0ntract l0w as the starting value are perhaps what gave pe0ple the idea that they c0uld put any starting value that is c0nvenient f0r them in the center 0f the Square 0f Nine. ‘C0nvenient, meaning they c0uld use fewer rings and still see the values 0n a small m0nit0r. In the C0mm0dity C0urse is a Square starting at a number that is p00rly described. Y0u must kn0w that these start values are highly significant levels and the targets are a great distance away. While the Cirde and Triangle Charts may help 0ur understanding, this d0es n0t mean 1 will change any meth0d 1 have passed 0n t0 y0u, n0r find reas0n t0 change h0w 1 have applied Gann’s Wheels. 1 am sure there

CHAPTER 3I

Less0n Eleven: U.5. t0-Yr Treasury N0tes—C0mputer M0deling Using

Astr0n0mical Cyde F0rmulas

Less0n Eleven will f0cus 0n c0mputer testing. This chapter was written in August but always seemed t0 break the fl0w 0f the next chapter. S0 it finally was bumped t0 the end and explains the time se- quence break in the charts. It is imp0rtant t0 kn0w that these cydes are neither subjective n0r d0 they fall int0 the kind 0f interpretati0n 0ne hears fr0m s0me analysts 0n CNBC using astr0l0gy. That is n0t what this b00k has discussed. Our meth0ds are mathematical and measurable.

We can test very different astr0l0gical phen0mena like aspects, midp0ints, Egyptian decans and dignities, edipses, planetary speed, m00n phases, and physical phen0mena like sunsp0t activity in mea- surable n0n-subjective ways. In 0ther w0rds, we can filter 0ut the “BS” and find the heart 0f what w0rks. If we can think 0f the questi0n t0 ask regarding an astr0n0mical event, we can test the c0ncept. As an example, is it true the 5&PSOO 90es up int0 a New M00n phase? The answer is yes, because we can determine fr0m S15 events that it 90es up 484 times, 0r 93.9 percent, five days bef0re the culminati0n. We can als0 leam that the effect lasts an0ther 2 days because we can pl0t ‘x’ days bef0re and after 0ur test criteria.

We will test and pl0t the effect 0n the U.5. IO-Yr-Treasury N0tes market using Timing S0luti0n (timings0luti0n.c0m). After testing

independent events we can create a cust0m m0del 0r equati0n by c0mbining the individual phen0mena.

Figure 3I.1 displays a menu 0f vari0us astr0n0mical criteria that 1 c0uld evaluate. In this first test 1 want t0 leam m0re ab0ut the angle 0f separati0n 0f the N0rth N0de 0f the M00n.

The M00n 0rbits the Earth 0n a path that is s0metimes bel0w the equat0r and 0ther times ab0ve the Equat0r. The dedinati0n 0f the M00n in the N0rthem Hemisphere was called by early astr0l0gers the Dra90n’s Head.

One 0f the missing n0tati0ns 0n the first set 0f Gann c0urses 1 b0ught was Gann’s chart n0tati0n 0r symb0l ‘“’. It was Gann’s way 0f marking the N0rth N0de ‘8 as the M00n passes up thr0ugh the equat0r. The p0int at which the M00n’s 0rbit breaks the plane 0f the Equat0r is the p0int 0f interest. H0wever, it is n0t just when it cr0sses the plane, but in which sign 0f the z0diac the transit 0ccurs that is 0ur f0cus.

N0t 0nly d0 1 want t0 kn0w m0re, but 1 want a very specific criteri0n assigned t0 the test. The N0rth N0de must be in 3° 0rb 0f separati0n and 1 0nly want t0 test when the N0rth N0de cr0sses the ediptic plane when itis 15° Aries t0 15° Taurus. 1 am 0nly interested in a 30° angle within the z0diac that falls in the middle 0f tw0 z0diac signs.

{ 723 }

---

In Figure 3I.1 are several 0pti0ns. Y0u will read under “The Angle Between Any Tw0 Planets Is:” that 1 will be testing a transit between Sun and the N0rth N0de 0n the ediptic plane. The 0rb 0f separati0n is set t0 3°, and 1 want n0 harm0nics. Then the angle range is set. 1 entered the Aries and Taurus angles 0f 15°.

Bel0w the middle frame is a wind0w with “+” and “—” and “Cal- culate.” 1 dick 0n “+” and the criteria ab0ve is written as a f0rmula. This f0rmula is ‘LI’ and y0u see it in the l0west wind0w. 1 am ready t0 test by dicking 0n ‘Calculate’.

Figure 3I.2 sh0ws the 0ccurrence 0f this test criteri0n against the market data fr0m I96S. It l00ks interesting, but we need t0 kn0w m0re. The next step is t0 run an efficiency test. In Figure 3I.3, the equati0n we created called ‘LI’ is 0n the b0tt0m 0f the frame. The pl0t ab0ve sh0ws the market tendency fr0m -IO t0 +IO days fr0m the culminati0n p0int at ‘0’. We disc0ver that there is a d0uble price l0w at A and B with the sec0nd falling near the 6th day after the event. The lighter dashed line in the backgr0und is sh0wing the tendency in 0nly the last 3 events. This sh0ws whether the tendency in the larger data sample is still relevant in near-term data. But n0w 1 am curi0us ab0ut this d0uble b0tt0m acti0n and want t0 see a wider time frame t0 find 0ut what effect this event may have 0n the market. 1 change the pr0perties 0n the right side t0 ‘wind0w (bars) 20’. Then rerun the calculati0n.

This is an event that 0ccurs with years between each culminati0n, s0 widening this peri0d t0 20 days bef0re and after makes sense. If y0u were testing m00n phases, it w0uld n0t. S0me th0ught must 90 int0 the setup t0 understand what y0u are trying t0 leam. Figure 3I.4 sh0ws the new test results. My “Elli0tt Wave” brain just steps int0 acti0n; this is a flat c0rrective pattem—interesting.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

Figure 3I.5 sh0ws my next step. 1 want t0 kn0w if this cyde has been the pattem 0ver the last 20 trades, meaning culminati0n events. The change is made in Figure 3I.5 within the highlighted 0val. In the r0w with the “+” and “—” sign is a refresh butt0n and my new update bec0mes LI. N0w 1 am ready t0 add my sec0nd event as we begin t0 create a simple m0del.

Figure 3I.6 sh0ws h0w 1 define a new phen0men0n. ‘L2’ is an aspect. 1 want t0 test 0ne y0u have seen me use 0ften in pri0r charts: Satum 72° Uranus using a 4° 0rb 0f separati0n (meaning plus 0r minus 2° either side 0f exact.) 1 dick 0n the ‘+’ and the s0ftware adds the f0rmula ‘L2’. Then 1 dick Calculate.

Figure 3I.7 displays LI and L2 culminati0ns under the market data. Figure 3I.8 sh0ws the efficiency test IO days bef0re and after Satum 72° Uranus. The culminati0n p0int is the vertical h0riz0ntal line at zer0. Y0u can see why 72° is an angle 0f great interest t0 me. Figure 3I.9 0pens the days 0f study fr0m 20 days bef0re and after. We can see that a significant trend reversal 0ccurs. But h0w significant is “sig- nificant?” If we traded the signal, what kind 0f result w0uld f0ll0w in terms 0f d0llars and in terms 0f strength 0f the signal?

Figure 3I.IO begins t0 examine that questi0n. 1 want t0 get an idea 0f what t0 expect in just the dedine fr0m day 4 t0 day 6. Understanding the latter swing is imp0rtant. 1 select just that segment 0f the results and see vari0us analytic results f0r ‘LI’s sec0nd swing d0wn.

Figure 3I.11 begins the pr0cess 0f evaluating win/l0ss rati0s f0r the N0rth N0de criteri0n. The final step is the future target f0r my new m0del. The f0recast targets April 0f 202I sh0wing a b0unce after a trending dedine. The lighter dashed line sh0ws the m0del remains relevant, but the b0unce c0uld c0me later than first expected. It means use my Elli0tt Wave structure t0 h0me in 0n this heads-up waming.

CHAPTER 32

Less0n Twelve: A Full 36O° Retum: A Study 0f England’s r9th-Century Panics and

Gl0bal Repercussi0ns Using Gann Analysis

T0day is December I3th, 20I8, and we have c0me t0 0ur last chapter 0f seri0us study with a seri0us message. The 32nd degree f0r Free- mas0ns is the highest level 0f their training. Y0u have eamed this distincti0n having f0ll0wed my discussi0n this year thr0ugh s0 many fields that c0vered all the tangents c0nnecting y0u t0 Gann’s w0rk.

It seems 0nly appr0priate that we make a full 36O° retum t0 h0w we first met with the study 0f England’s Panics 0f the nineteenth century. This time we are better armed t0 study these panics and assess if there is a c0nnecti0n between them. Over the c0urse 0f 0ur discussi0ns t0gether we have seen several culminating wamings 0f a new panic drawing near.

S0me 0f these signs menti0ned thr0ugh0ut the b00k are:

The 9O-year cyde in Figure 20.4.

Gann’s Perpetual NYSE Map 20I9 t0 202I (Figure 20.I6). S0lar Minimum due 2020-202I (S0cial Behavi0r Instability). Jupiter Satum Uranus transit 0f Earth Signs (Figure 20.28).

Butt0nw00d Agreement, 20-year cyde falls 0n 20I9.

Perhaps the m0st alarming f0r me was a study we began in Chapter 3I. N0w we will chart the cyde, and we sh0uld be fully aware 0f its

implicati0ns and the c0rrelati0n t0 the ec0n0mic panics 0ver a span 0f tw0 centuries 0f hist0ry.

A. THE MOON’5 NORTH NODE

L0ng a90 1 menti0ned the Gann c0urses 1 b0ught that had missing n0tati0ns due t0 the many generati0ns 0f c0pying 0f c0pies. The missing sign was f0r the M00n’s N0rth N0de. 1 began t0 study why Gann might have had such an interest in the N0rth N0de. As y0u will see in Figure 32.1, the ediptic angle 0f the N0rth N0de literally has a “panic” H0t 20ne in the SW quarter 0f Aries, Taurus, and Gemini. The dates and z0diac p0siti0n 0f the N0rth N0de during panics in England and the Americas is excepti0nal. The Panic 0f I86S was in 0pp0siti0n t0 the w0rst depressi0n in American hist0ry. The number 0f Panics in the SW quadrant versus 0ther quadrants is alarming. The pr0blem is this: the N0rth N0de d0es n0t transit this quadrant 0ften; it will transit Gemini and Taurus in the years 202I and 2022. It enters the danger z0ne in 2020.

N0w c0nsider the Elli0tt Wave c0unts 1 have put in the charts f0r markets in Asia, Eur0pe, and the Americas and Canada. C0nsider the astr0n0mical events and Gann cydes we have studied that culminate in 2020. We have seen different disciplines that p0int t0 the same

The study 0f aspects and hist0rical p0ints 0f interest in the American Business Cyde is useful f0r making a m0re scientific study 0f each culminati0n defined. It is als0 rec0mmended that y0u test these aspects in Eur0pean and Asian markets. Y0u will find these aspects are n0t always the 0nes 0f greatest interest in Asian ec0n0mies. But y0u will find a chain reacti0n 0f Time Fact0rs that r0lls thr0ugh t0day’s markets. If y0u can create an MS Excel spreadsheet, the time cydes will fall thr0ugh the markets in an 0rderly and expected manner. G0ld cydes lead EURUSD, which leads Oil, which leads Equities, and rates sh0uld lead st0cks, but are 0ften 0ut 0f sync. Keep watch 0f the leading market t0 y0ur primary index and study the Time Fact0rs in the lead market as an early waming in y0ur 0wn. H0wever, it is my h0pe y0u have bec0me very aware that there is a sect0r y0u must never ign0re—Banks. The rep0rts fr0m the G0vemment can be gl0wing and sing praises 0f an ec0n0mic rec0very, but if defaults 0n c0nsumer aut0 l0ans are steadily rising, 0r new single h0me c0nstructi0n is falling, the message under the surface sh0uld be read as saying that c0nsumer ec0n0mic health d0es n0t reflect the 90vemment rep0rts. S0mething is very wr0ng. Always be aware 0f credit liquidity—the ability t0 0btain a l0an by a business 0r c0nsumer. When credit is tight, there is a pr0blem devel0ping. Banks—they have always been the real bellwether. Watch y0ur charts 0f gl0bal banks like a hawk.

Many take the weighting 0f the Bank 0f H0ng K0ng t00 lightly as it is n0t a Sharia st0ck. The TASI index is heavily weighted t0 bank st0cks. G0 by the st0ck weighting within the index and n0t the v0lume 0f Sharia trade activity that is set up by cultural limitati0ns. Traders unfamiliar with the TASI ex- change sh0uld be aware that they are permitted t0 trade 0n the l0ng side 0nly. An exchange that d0es n0t permit sh0rt selling creates maj0r pr0blems as there is n0 0ne in the market t0 buy-t0-c0ver. This is essential t0 stabilize a hard fall at critical supp0rt levels.

This list 0f bank st0cks all0ws me t0 set up three screen pages each displaying eight bank st0ck charts. Only the price in a weekly 0r m0nthly h0riz0n is needed. 1 d0 n0t rec0mmend candles f0r this applicati0n because they limit the price range 0f the x-axis t00 much. Bar charts all0w eight years 0f m0nthly data t0 remain in view with a spacing that is meaningful t0 read with0ut a need t0 enlarge 0ne 0f the eight charts in view. Analysts wh0 fav0r candles need t0 rec0nsider the practice 0f c0mpressing candles s0 all they see is a fuzzy line chart. Such a display has little t0 d0 with candle pattems.

Bel0w price use just 0ne 0scillat0r which we will meet again in Ap-

pendix M. This unassuming p0wer t00l was first referenced in Chapter 20 in the L0st M0ti0n discussi0n. It is a simple 7-peri0d detrended 0s- cillat0r used in vari0us p0ints within the b00k. A quick scan 0f these bank charts every week and y0u will kn0w m0re than m0st ab0ut the inherent risks devel0ping ar0und the w0rld which we cann0t see 0r have n0t read ab0ut. As an example, 0n y0ur 0wn screen view t0- gether the bank st0cks: BAC, PNC, and WFC in a m0nthly chart. Add a simple 7-peri0d detrended 0scillat0r bel0w the price data f0r each chart. The sec0nd 0scillat0r extreme highs in January 0f 20I8 align with maj0r l0ng-term Gann Time Fact0rs. The tw0 meth0ds t0gether 0n the Banking Sect0r was a str0ng waming 0f what was t0 devel0p in 20I8. The largest market breaks d0 n0t c0me fr0m this setup 0ff the divergence 0scillat0r extreme highs in a m0nthly chart. This was the first sh0e t0 dr0p in the gl0bal game 0f d0min0es falling. The 0scillat0r will likely fall back t0 the extreme l0ws 0n the b0tt0m 0f the m0nthly screen where banks can stage a rec0very. Then the 0scillat0r will advance up int0 the m0mentum displacement where this 0scillat0r has b0tt0med f0r each pullback during the bull market since 2011 int0 20I8 in m0nthly data. Y0u will be l00king at a h0ri- z0ntal level 0f supp0rt that bec0mes resistance int0 late 20I9 0r 2020. The larger break 0ften c0mes when this h0riz0ntal level that was 0nce supp0rt bec0mes resistance 0n a Gann Time Fact0r. Heads-up... the markets we traced thr0ugh0ut this year in 20I8 gave us a dress re- hearsal f0r the main event still t0 c0me. Banks will be 0ur wind0w int0 the larger dedine in the future, just as they have d0ne thr0ugh0ut the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. One c0uld say in 20I8: L00king Back fr0m 2020 / 2022.

CHAPTER 33

A Letter t0 the United Grand L0dge 0f England 0n Behalf 0f Gann, Freemas0ns’ Hall

A. “I7M CONFIDENT THE CURATOR WILL WANT TO SPEAK WITH YOU...”

Six traders were invited t0 attend a 0ne-time seminar 1 gave in the Stati0n Master’s R00m 0f the St. Pancras H0tel in L0nd0n. That r00m has hist0ry f0r me n0w as all my Eur0pean seminars are held in that c0zy r00m with incredibly high ceilings. The d00r is massive, and y0u kn0w as y0u enter that s0mething special is ab0ut t0 begin.

The six traders knew 0f Gann’s suitcase. The three-day seminar w0uld reveal f0r them the f0rmula Gann had been w0rking 0n when he passed. It was a kn0wledgeable gr0up as they had all attended my 3- and 5-day Gann seminars. They had a few years’ experience using Gann’s meth0ds. The preparati0n t00k me nine m0nths f0r this 0ne seminar t0 be given 0nly 0nce. In hindsight, 1 realize n0w that it was this preparati0n f0r them that put this massive v0lume 0f w0rk in s0me sense 0f 0rder. It was an imp0rtant step t0ward this b00k.

The six traders menti0ned in Chapter 15 represented many cultures: America, Great Britain, India, Saudi Arabia, and Africa.

The three days were an excepti0nal experience f0r all 0f us, and we decided that it was imp0rtant t0 end 0ur time t0gether by visiting the United Grand L0dge 0f England. 1 had 90ne 0nce and had been disapp0inted that it was d0sed in preparati0n 0f an event, s0 1 was thrilled that every0ne wanted t0 90.

We went thr0ugh the t0ur 0f the Grand Hall, and we f0und 0ur- selves dismayed by the fact that the guide w0uld n0t answer any “real” questi0ns. We then started t0 expl0re t0gether the Grand building. Behind 0ne d00r there is a l0ng library 0f freestanding handcrafted w00den cases with glass d00rs end0sing l0cked b00ks in stacked r0ws maybe nine feet high—d0zens and d0zens 0f them. At the end 0f the library is the museum where the hist0ric ar- tifacts are h0used. As 1 wandered thr0ugh the museum 1 became alarmed.

1 put my hand in my p0cket. 1 felt Gann’s 32nd Jewel. S0, 1 left the museum and walked back thr0ugh the library t0 the Librarian that guarded the Freemas0ns’ d0main. 1 pulled 0ut Gann’s 32nd Jewel fr0m my p0cket and explained, “W0uld y0u please h0ld this f0r me. 1 am in y0ur museum, and 1 d0 n0t want y0u t0 think 1 have taken s0mething 0f y0urs during my visit.”

He l00ked at the Jewel. He l00ked at me. He l00ked at the Jewel. He then l00ked back at me. Then he began t0 study the Jewel with great interest, flipped it 0ver, then flipped it back and studied the fr0nt exceedingly d0sely again.

He asked me, “Where did y0u get this?” 1 explained as briefly as 1 c0uld why it was in my p0ssessi0n and wh0 Gann was t0 American financial analysts. He was extremely interested and said, “Enj0y y0ur visit t0 the museum. 1 will h0ld this Jewel f0r y0u and will be c0n-

tacting the Curat0r 0f the museum.” The man then said, “1’m c0n- fident the Curat0r will want t0 speak with y0u...”

When 1 finished my wanderings thr0ugh the museum, 1 retumed t0 the Br0ther Librarian. He said that the Curat0r had been n0tified, and he wanted t0 speak with me. The Librarian made a brief call t0 say 1 had retumed. He n0dded and hung up. 1 was then t0ld the Curat0r w0uld be right d0wn.

A very pleasant, kind man intr0duced himself t0 me. He asked me t0 fill in s0me 0f the many gaps in my preliminary discussi0n with the Librarian. 1 leamed that they were extremely interested in this particular Jewel because it was still active. It had never been can- celled and was dearly very 0ld. By n0w my gr0up had j0ined us. 1 realized that there was n0 better place in the w0rld f0r Gann’s 32nd Jewel than in the museum 0f the Grand L0dge. 1 0ffered t0 d0nate it t0 them. The Curat0r wanted me t0 sign papers that 0wnership was being surrendered and a h0st 0f 0ther details. 1 then t0ld him 1 had all 0f Gann’s Freemas0n artifacts. The Curat0r said they w0uld like t0 take a l00k at them. 1 pr0mised that up0n my retum t0 America 1 w0uld ship the c0llecti0n t0 him. Every0ne wh0 had been in the seminar was quite spellb0und that this was all happening.

Papers signed, and Jewel surrendered, 1 then asked the curat0r a questi0n. “May 1 please see a b00k in y0ur library?” 1 explained 1 knew the title and auth0r.

The curat0r said, “We cann0t l0cate a b00k by a title 0r auth0r’s name. We have t0 kn0w the l0cati0n number. D0 y0u have this?”

1 then said, “Sir, 1 d0 n0t, but 1 kn0w exactly where it is in y0ur library.”

He tumed t0 the Librarian with a questi0ning glance. The Librarian answered with a shrug 0f his sh0ulders.

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

The Curat0r then said, “Can y0u p0int the b00k 0ut t0 me?” He gestured t0 the Librarian t0 c0me with us as he was the guardian 0f all the keys. The Librarian was as surprised as was my gr0up. 1 was then t0ld t0 lead the way.

1 pr0mptly walked d0wn numer0us r0ws 0f freestanding b00k- shelves and with0ut a pause st0pped at 0ne r0w, tumed left, p0inted t0 a b0tt0m shelf 0n the fl00r level, and then t0 a b00k ab0ut nine b00ks in. The b00k’s title? The Revelati0ns 0f a Square.

The Librarian questi0ned what t0 d0 next. The Curat0r assured him it was Okay t0 0pen the case. The very 0ld b00k was carefully rem0ved and handed first t0 the Curat0r, and he then passed it 0n t0 me. 1 0pened the b00k and immediately s0ught the page number 1 was l00king f0r. There, next t0 the passage, was a pencil bracket marking the text. 1 read the paragraph t0 my gr0up.

1 thumbed thr0ugh several pages that were marked, and then carefully retumed the b00k t0 the Curat0r. He asked me, “H0w did y0u kn0w where t0 find this b00k am0ng s0 many? Have y0u been here bef0re?”

1 gulped, n0t sure h0w my answer w0uld be received. “It will s0und strange, it is strange t0 me; but 1 have n0t been here bef0re, sir. 1 d0n’t kn0w why, but /An0w y0ur Library well, and 1 c0uld p0int t0 the exact l0cati0n 0f several b00ks that 1 am very familiar with.”

The Curat0r tumed t0 me and said, “Y0u have been here bef0re.” 1 underst00d exactly what he was telling me.

1 retumed t0 America and packed up all 0f Gann’s artifacts. In the package was a letter 1 had written t0 the Curat0r. The letter gave s0me details ab0ut h0w Gann had applied the teachings 0f the Sc0ttish Rite Freemas0ns. He was true t0 their teachings and revealed n0thing in plain sight. But 1 summarized in a very l0ng letter h0w the

studies 0f the ancient Quadrivium fields 0f Harm0nics, Astr0n0my, Numer0l0gy, and Ge0metry gave undeniable pr00f that there was a Grand Engineer t0 all these fields 0f perfecti0n. Gann was passing this wisd0m 0n t0 us in a th0ughtful way that might make us aware. My letter had sufficient c0ntent that 1 h0ped w0uld sh0w credibility and respect f0r their teachings. 1 then dem0nstrated h0w we applied these fields t0 financial markets, giving further pr00f Universal Laws indeed apply t0 all things... induding markets. 1 sent everything 0ff t0 the Curat0r in L0nd0n with a prayer it might find its destinati0n and n0t get l0st.

1 leamed that the c0llecti0n was t00 large f0r their museum. The c0llecti0n w0uld have t0 be retumed at my expense. H0wever, there was a pr0blem. The Curat0r explained that the 32nd Jewel had been cancelled, as it sh0uld have been when Gann passed. H0wever, he knew that the 32nd Jewel sh0uld be part 0f the c0llecti0n as it and the Master Apr0n were the m0st valuable artifacts. The 0ther pr0blem was that the 32nd Jewel c0uld n0t be retumed t0 me with0ut B0ard appr0val—a surrendered Jewel is never retumed. The Curat0r ex- plained that a B0ard meeting was s00n appr0aching and he w0uld explain t0 the 0thers what had devel0ped.

Time passed. The balance 0f the c0llecti0n arrived, and 1 awaited further news 0f Gann’s 32nd Jewel.

An email finally arrived fr0m the Curat0r. He explained that the B0ard had appr0ved the retum 0f the surrendered Jewel. Plus, they had decided t0 retum it t0 me in the c0nditi0n in which it had been surrendered... uncancelled. They said my letter w0uld be kept.

L0ng after that email Gann’s 32nd Jewel arrived in my mail, with the very c00l shipping labels 0f the Grand L0dge. With that b0x n0w h0using the Jewel, my life m0ved f0rward and 1 th0ught that this was

by far the best c0ndusi0n 0f an amazing trip t0 L0nd0n. H0wever, 1 still needed t0 find the right h0me f0r Gann’s artifacts.

Then 0ne day, m0st unexpectedly, a letter arrived fr0m 6O Great Queen’s Street. Inside was a letter explaining that my library card w0uld be arriving under separate c0ver. It arrived attached t0 the f0rm y0u see in Figure 33.2. On the b0tt0m is the laminated white Library Card. (1 have pr0tected the number.) Very c00l, but sh0cking—as this card might be the rarest admittance card t0 their b00ks in the w0rld. Why? If y0u d0 n0t kn0w the cust0ms 0f the Sc0ttish Rite Freemas0ns... w0men are f0rbidden.

Larry Jac0bs has been a champi0n 0f Gann and his meth0ds f0r as l0ng as 1 can remember, dating fr0m bef0re 1 first entered this industry. 1 feel that this artide, first published by Mr. Jac0bs in Traders W0rld Magazine (tradersw0rld.c0m) and written by Gann’s grands0n, is a befitting way t0 end 0ur studies 0f Gann’s meth0ds. It is reprinted by permissi0n. It is n0t 0ffered as an hist0rical d0cument, but as a rec0rd 0f sentiment and respect expressed t0ward his grandfather as J0hn L. Gann, Jr. remembered him.

It has been an enriching j0umey f0r me t0 walk d0wn Gann’s f00tpath. What’s ahead f0r me? Teaching.

was heading t0ward extincti0n as each new generati0n had t0 start the pr0cess fr0m the beginning all 0ver again. India was p0sting inc0rrect teachings which were then being taught by an0ther generati0n. Gann’s actual meth0ds w0uld have been l0st if this had c0ntinued. N0w it is my h0pe that y0u can m0ve this w0rk f0rward, and we can end the c0nstant l00p back in time t0 the beginning.

There is 0ne last fact that sure as heck amazes me. Acc0rding t0 the Micr0s0ft d0cument pr0perties in “Details,” this b00k was started March 23, 20I8 at IO:38 a.m. The final chapter was c0mpleted De- cember 20, 20I8—T0tal writing time 1,S11 h0urs; 44 minutes. March 23 was 3 days after the 20I8 spring equin0x. The b00k was finished just sh0rt 0f the winter s0lstice. Christmas, with the T0tal Lunar Edipse appr0aching January 4th, means that 1 am a trader again and my pers0nal cyde beat is t0 c0nsider the start 0f a fifth wave rally in the S8&PS0OO. My life rev0lves ar0und Gann time fact0rs, wave c0unts, and ge0metry. 1 cann0t c0mplain as these meth0ds have helped guide my life decisi0ns.

If we use numer0l0gy f0r the start 0f the b00k--which was a time ch0sen by accident and n0t planned at all (my beagle had surgery t0 repair b0th knees and 1 was caring f0r him and decided, “T0day we start the b00k!”)—s0 if we d0 use numer0l0gy, we find that the Fadic number 0f O3/23/20I8 is 9, the same Fadic number 1 share with Gann’s birthday. The c0mpleti0n date 0n I2/20/20I8 is the Fadic number 0f 7, Gann’s m0st valued friend.

B. ARTICLE BY JOHN L. GANN, JR.

If y0u had been a businessman traveling acr0ss Texas in 289I, y0u might have b0ught a newspaper and a c0uple 0f cigars fr0m a tall, lanky 23-year-0ld selling them 0n y0ur train. And as y0u talked with y0ur fell0w travelers ab0ut investments, y0u might have n0ticed the y0uth eaves- dr0pping intently 0n y0ur c0nversati0n.

Ify0u had asked him, the b0y might have t0ld y0u his name was W illy and, yes, he was interested in c0mm0dities. His dad was a farmer in An- gelina C0unty, and just ab0ut every0ne he knew was as well. They were all c0ncemed ab0ut the price their c0tt0n w0uld bring. And had y0u inquired whether y0ung Willy als0 wanted t0 till the East Texas s0il when he 90t 0lder, he might have said n0, he didn’t think s0: he wanted t0 be a busi- nessman. “Well, 900d luck, y0ung Willy,” y0u might have said. “Maybe y0ull have y0ur 0wn business s0meday, maybe y0u'll even be fam0us. Wh0 kn0ws? N0 0ne can predict the future.” The y0ung eavesdr0pper 90ing up and d0wn the aisles 0f that train was William Delbert Gann.

---

Was it really true, he might have w0ndered, that n0 0ne can predict the future?

W. D. Gann was b0m 0n a farm s0me seven miles 0utside 0f Lufkin, Texas, 0n June 6, I878. He was the firstb0m 0f 11 children [sic] 0f Sam H0ust0n Gann and Susan R. Gann. The Gann’ lived in a t00 small h0use with n0 ind00r plumbing and with n0t much 0f anything else. They were p00r, and y0ung Willy walked the seven miles int0 Lufkin f0r three years t0 90 t0 sch00l.

But the w0rk he c0uld d0 0n the farm was m0re imp0rtant t0 the family, s0 W. D. never even graduated fr0m grammar sch00l 0r attended high sch00l. As the eldest b0y, he had a special resp0nsibility, and th0se years w0rking 0n the farm may have been the beginning 0f his lifel0ng dedt- cati0n t0 hard w0rk. His religi0us upbringing as a Baptist may als0 have had s0mething t0 d0 with it, f0r his faith stayed with him thr0ugh0ut his life as well.

A few years later W.D. w0rked in a br0kerage in Texarkana and at- tended business sch00l at night. He married Rena May Smith, and tw0 daughters, Macie and N0ra, were b0m in the first few years 0f the new twentieth century. W.D. made the fateful m0ve t0 New Y0rk City in I9O3 at the age 0f 2S.

W0rking m0st likely at a maj0r Wall Street br0kerage, W.D. made 0ther changes in his life as well. He div0rced his Texas bride and in I9O8 at the age 0f 30 married a I9-year-0ld c0lleen named Sarah Hannify. W.D. and Sadie had tw0 children—Velma, b0m in I9O9 and W.D.’s 0nly s0n, J0hn, wh0 arrived six years later. In additi0n, Macie and N0ra came t0 live with their father and were raised in New Y0rk by their Irish stepm0ther.

During the First W0rld War the family m0ved fr0m Manhattan t0 Br00klyn first t0 Bay Ridge, then t0 Flatbush. W. D. rep0rtedly predicted the N0vember 9, I928 abdicati0n 0f the Kaiser and the end 0f the war. But

it was after the armistice that the f0rtunes 0f the Ganns 0f Br00klyn t00k their m0st dramatic tum. The W.D. that traders kn0w t0day emerged in the R0aring Twenties.

In I9I9 at the age 0f 4I, W. D. Gann quit his j0b and went 0ut 0n his 0wn. He spent the rest 0f his life building his 0wn business. He began publishing a daily market letter, The Supply and Demand Letter. The letter c0vered b0th st0cks and c0mm0dities and pr0vided its readers with annual f0recasts. F0recasting was an activity with which W.D. had bec0me fascinated. The y0ung business pr0spered, and three years later W. D. Gann became a h0me0wner, buying a small h0use 0n Fenim0re Street in his ad0pted h0me 0f Br00klyn. The market letter led t0 m0re ambiti0us publishing. In I924 W.D.° first b00k, Truth 0f the St0ck Tape, was published.

A pi0neering w0rk 0n chart reading, it ts still regarded by s0me as the best b00k ever written 0n the subject. An individualist and ambiti0us hard w0rker, W.D. self-published Truth thr0ugh his new Financial Guardian Publishing C0mpany. He pers0nally wr0te his 0wn ads t0 market ut and ne90tiated with b00kst0res t0 carry it. ‘Truth’ was praised by The Wall Street J0umal and s0ld well f0r years. S0me c0nsider it the best 0f his many b00ks. F0r a first eff0rt it was a significant acc0mplishment.

His market f0recasts during the twenties were rep0rtedly 8S percent accurate. But W. D. didn’t c0nfine his pr0gn0sticati0ns t0 prices. It was widely rep0rted he predicted the electi0ns 0f Wils0n and Harding and, indeed, 0f every president since I9O4. At age 49, W. D. Gann wr0te what is perhaps his m0st unusual b00k, the 2927 Tunnel Thru The Air. /t zs a pr0phetic w0rk 0f ficti0n, n0t a genre every Wall Street analyst dabbles in. But W. D. Gann was 0ne 0f a kind. The b00k is perhaps best kn0wn f0r having predicted that attack 0n the United States by Japan and an air war between the tw0 p0wers. Th0ugh Tunnel may have had little t0

0ffer invest0rs, it was well-publicized and enhanced its auth0r’s gr0wing reputati0n.

The market in the I9203 seemed t0 be defying the law 0f gravity, but W. D. Gann didn’t think it c0uld last f0rever. In his f0recast f0r I929, he predicted the market w0uld hit new highs until early April, then ex- perience a sharp break, then resume with new highs until September 3. Then it w0uld t0p and afterward w0uld c0me the biggest market crash in us hist0ry. We all kn0w what happened.

W. D. Gann pr0spered during the Depressi0n, which he predicted w0uld end in I932. He acquired seats 0n vari0us c0mm0dities exchanges, traded f0r his 0wn acc0unt, wr0te Wall Street St0ck Select0r in 2930 and New St0ck Trend Detect0r in 2936. He c0ntinued making remarkably ac- curate f0recasts as well as s0me less successful 0nes like the elect0ral defeat 0f FDR. He devel0ped a new interest in investing in Fl0rida real estate. He became a small-scale h0me-builder in Miami as well as the 0wner 0f a bl0ck 0f st0res 0n the Tamiami Trail.

He als0 became airb0me. He b0ught a plane in I932SO he c0uld fly 0ver cr0p areas making 0bservati0ns t0 use in his f0recasts. He hired Elin0r Smith, a n0ted 27-year-0ld aviat0r, t0 fly him ar0und. The n0velty 0f his high-flying research—W.D. was the first t0 study markets in this way— helped keep him in the sp0tlight.

W. D. Gann’s s0n J0hn Gann als0 went int0 the securities business in I936 at the age 0f 22. A year later he went t0 w0rk f0r his dad until in I9.4I his Unde Sam ann0unced he had plans f0r the y0ung man in Eur0pe. Back in Br00klyn, Sadie had health pr0blems f0r s0me time and died at age S3 in I942. Then after 20 years 0n Fenim0re Street, an aging W. D. Gann m0ved t0 Miami f0r reas0ns b0th 0f health and pers0nal preference. His H0w t0 make Pr0fits in C0mm0dities came 0ut the same year.

He kept his business in New Y0rk, relying 0n his l0ng-time pers0nal

secretary. In Miami he c0ntinued studying the market, trading, real estate investing, and instructing students. The next ‘year at the age 0f 6S, when m0st are thinking retirement, W.D. decided he'd get married and did, t0 a much y0unger w0man.

S0n J0hn w0rked 0n W. D. Gann business in New Y0rk briefly after the war, then left t0 pursue his 0wn interests in the Industry. The tw0 differed in their appr0ach t0 the market. J0hn L. Gann pursued a successful lifetime career with Wall Street’s maj0r br0kerage h0uses until his passing in I984.

The p0st-war years saw Gann start taking it easier. He published 4S Years in Wall Street in 2949. He s0ld his business t0 J0seph Lederer, a fell0w student 0f the market. Ar0und the same time, he als0 separately s0ld the rights t0 all his b00ks t0 Edward Lambert. He c0ntinued, h0wever, t0 study, teach, and trade. He was made an h0n0rary member 0f the Inter- nati0nal Mark Twain S0ciety in I9SO.

In I9S4 he suffered a heart attack. A ‘year later advanced st0mach cancer was disc0vered. The d0ct0rs 0perated, but W. D. Gann failed t0 rec0ver. He died in June I9SS, at the age 0f 77. He was buried with his sec0nd wife in Green- W00d Cemetery in Br00klyn at a l0cati0n that l00ks t0ward Wall Street. It was a fitting l0cati0n since he had studied the Street all his adult life.

In I99S, 4O years after his passing, William D. Gann is still talked ab0ut, written ab0ut, and studied avidly. It’s an extra0rdinary testim0nial t0 his w0rk and 0ne that even WD. c0uldn't have predicted. Or c0uld he? What less0ns might there be in this remarkable man’s life?

Furst ts an affirmati0n 0f the American Dream. William Delbert Gann 0f Lufkin, Texas, started with n0thing. He and his family had n0 m0ney, n0 educati0n, and n0 pr0spects. But less than 4O years after 0verhearing businessmen talk 0n railr0ad cars in Texas, W. D. Gann was kn0wn ar0und the w0rld.

---

Sec0nd, hard w0rk pays. W. D. Gann r0se early, w0rked late, and ap- pr0ached his business with great energy. Virtually all his educati0n was self-administered. This teacher, writer, and prescient f0recaster had a third-grade f0rmal educati0n. But he never st0pped reading.

Third, unc0nventi0nal thinking may have its merits. WD. was intellec- tually curi0us t0 an extra0rdinary degree. He was unafraid 0f un0rth0d0x ideas, whether in finance 0r in 0ther areas 0f life. He wasn’t always right— n0ne 0f us are—but he dared t0 pursue a better idea.

F0urth, there may be s0mething t0 that dean-living business after all. A c0nservative Baptist, W.D. didn’t sm0ke, drink, play cards, 0r dance. He was seri0us in demean0r and a c0nservative dresser, alth0ugh he lightened up s0mewhat in his later years. He respected the value 0f a d0llar and was prudent in his pers0nal spending. N0t every intemati0nally acdaimed seer w0uld c0ntinue t0 live in a m0dest h0use in Br00klyn.

Fifth, faith helps. W. D. Gann studied the Bible all his life. It was his

V11. The 32nd Jewel: Gann Analysis—Part 2, Price and Time

B00k 0f B00ks. His 0wn last b00k, The Magic W0rd, published in 29SO, str0ngly reflects this dev0ti0n.

And finally, the 0nly less0n f0r traders 1 will venture t0 0ffer is W. D. Gann never st0pped studying the market. Even after his f0recasts happened, even after he achieved intemati0nal acdaim. Alth0ugh he believed in cydes, he als0 knew that markets are always changing and that dectst0ns must be made based 0n t0day’s c0nditi0ns, n0t yesterdays.

WD. might have rested 0n his laurels. But he kept studying and seeking greater understanding. If he c0uldn't aff0rd t0 st0p, can any trader aff0rd t0 d0 s0?

Hell0 C0nnie,

Thank y0u s0 much f0r y0ur reply. Y0u made my “heart feel 900d” ‘f0r lack 0f w0rds. A special Thanks f0r the briefcase explanati0n as Ihave always n0t w0ndered what was in it but when did y0u get it. Ihad written a letter t0 Elin0r and p0ured my heart 0ut t0 her in the letter as 1 wanted t0 meet her. My letters and inf0rmati0n are all at h0me 1 think this must have been ab0ut I997??? 1 think earlier she had had surgery and 1 talked t0 a care giver. 1 even mailed the picture 0f her with WD beside the airplane t0 her. Oh, well, l0ts 0f mem0ries.

Mercy, Lam s0 pleased 1 wr0te t0 y0u. Y0ur name was grinding in my mind. 1 have held 0n s0 l0ng, a pers0n has t0 be s0 spectal t0 be a guardian and 1 feel as if my time is thr0ugh. Ihave talked t0 several pe0ple f0r advice and n0thing seems t0 fit. As usual 1 have t0 d0 it my way.

C0nnie, 1 d0n’t have t0 tell y0u Mr. Gann is alive and well with his charts. If 0ne d0es n0t understand that they d0 n0t deserve t0 be ar0und his things and 1 d0 n0t want t0 c0nsider them. 1 can tell y0u s0 much.

The c0llecti0n ts n0t all there 1 d0n’t have t0 tell y0u that st0ry [CB: as 1 knew it and we discussed it 0n the ph0ne h0w the 0riginal Billy

J0nes c0llecti0n had been split 0ne night during an ugly div0rce. She saved half and the 0ther was st0len and taken t0 Chica90 in a rental truck by Billy.] H0wever, n0 0ne kn0ws h0w much Ihave and what Ihave c0llected 0ver the years. Iam an h0nest and very much b0tt0m line pers0n. 1 believe maybe the c0mment “t0 damn 0ld” c0mes t0 mind. 1 have n0t all0wed any0ne t0 l00k at what 1 have f0r 0ver ten years.

Everything 1 have is safe and well cared f0r h0wever there are a Sew spider webs that c0me with the c0llecti0n. [CB: That was an under- statement. When 1 did my due diligence, 1 f0und there were 0wnership issues with her s0n after she started a new c0mpany t0 pr0tect it fr0m liabilities. Theref0re, her s0n C0dy had legal j0int 0wnership. There were c0ncems 1 had that there was n0 c0ntr0l 0ver the meaning 0f ‘c0mplete.’ W0uld 1 be sent the missing critical b0x suddenly f0und in a cupb0ard years later?]

Thave tried t0 value the c0llecti0n. Again, a dead end as there is n0thing t0 c0mpare it with. 1 have tried t0 put t0gether a s0rt 0f invent0ry list h0wever it w0uld take m0nths t0 detail every letter and artide and 1 d0 n0t have that much time. [CB: 1 did n0t understand this sentence t0 mean time remaining t0 live. Deep regrets n0w.]

What Iam asking is s0mewhere between 1.5 & 2 milli0n d0llars, spread 0ver time s0 the taxes d0 n0t take it all. lam asking $2S,OOO f0r s0me0ne t0 spend 3 days, n0 cameras, cell ph0nes etc. if they want t0 w0rk with

1 d0n’t kn0w what else t0 say. 1 have s0 many ideas and n0 0ne t0 w0rk with. It is time Mr. Gann had a w0rking partner again.

[CB: During a f0ll0w-up ph0ne call with Nikki 1 agreed t0 pay her $2S,OOO and w0uld discuss an 0ffer f0r $1 milli0n with payments 0ver a 0ne-year time peri0d. H0wever, 1 wanted t0 pay the $2S,OOO di- rectly t0 the bank threatening a f0red0sure. 1 wanted t0 kn0w wh0 the debt h0lder was in this transacti0n. If they defaulted 1 w0uld make the 0ffer directly t0 the bank. Her s0n C0dy was unkn0wingly 0n the ph0ne as we sp0ke and suddenly C0dy jumped in and challenged any 0ffer with payments 0ver time. It was awkward f0r C0dy as he did n0t kn0w ab0ut the discussi0n 1 had bef0rehand with Nikki. 1 did n0t kn0w Nikki was terminally ill with 0nly preci0us m0nths t0 live. 1 can 0nly imagine the stress C0dy was feeling.

G00dness Nikki,

1 am very h0n0red that y0u th0ught 0f me as y0u have been a w0n- derful champi0n and guardian. My trip t0 L0nd0n wasa special event f0r 6 invited pr0fessi0nals. 1 released I4 years 0f research as 1 knew 1 n0w needed a supp0rt gr0up.

The c0ntents 0f Elin0r Smith’s suitcase was actually a math pr0blem that Gann c0uld n0t c0mplete. It t00k me years, but 1 finished it and 1 suspect Elin0r was the pers0n he had tumed t0 f0r mathematics supp0rt.

The release was last week! N0thing seems t0 happen by accident these days.

MMREM d0ubtless be 0f interest t0 th0se wh0se searchings f0r m0re Light have led them bey0nd the sublunar pales int0 the star-fields.

Primarily, the idea suggested itself by reas0n 0f certain unwh0les0me c0nditi0ns 0nly t00 palpable t0 the rank and file 0f all interested in the higher meanings 0f Astr0l0gy— c0nditi0ns that, despite 0ccasi0nal sincere eff0rt t0wards achievement, c0uld lead 0nly t0 c0nfused and negligible end- ings.

These and 0ther deterrent facts were given careful c0gita- ti0n, with vari0us c0rrective and emendat0ry schemes duly c0nsidered, till finally what seemed t0 be salient features 0f a real s0luti0n suggested themselves. These were submitted t0 the judgment 0f 0ther minds similarly actuated with the 0ne supreme desire t0 impart a m0re elevating and utilitarian spirit t0 the Cause. And thus br0ught thr0ugh the leavening pr0cess these ideas fructified in the present undertaking, which presents n0t 0nly a unique, but, we believe, a th0r0ughly feasible plan t0 administer m0re adequately t0 the demands 0f a science which, th0ugh h0ary with age, has been s0 per- sistently denied its rightful place in the sch0lastic c0uncils.

And s0 the pr0ject, 0nce decided up0n, was quietly br0ught t0 a practical issue by a C0uncil 0f F0ur in New Y0rk 0n January I4, I9I6 (time 0f assembly, 7.15 p.m.), being c0m- mem0rated in Capric0m agreeably with the alchemic require- ments in the expressi0n 0f a cydic law; and that the inaugural w0rk might be facilitated, and as a tentative 0fficial b0dy, these f0ur assumed said functi0ns f0r the first year’s ten- ancy, 0r f0r such time as shall elapse till the date 0f annual electi0n is pr0perly assigned.

It was further res0lved, in acc0rdance with a Hermetic and kabalistic plan, and because 0f its mystical character and aims, t0 restrict the membership t0 Thirty. It is the perfect number (IO) tripled in a rati0 0f fruitfulness (3), and equates with Arcane 11I. 0f the Planetary Cirdes, signified by “Isis-Urania,” the generative principle in the manifesting realms. This p0int is ruled by Venus, the Egyptian Isis, cr0wned with twelve stars, the s0lar nimbus ab0ut her head symb0lizing the creative p0wer 0f Intelligence, while the eyes c0vering the cube 0n which she sits emblemize the visi0ns 0f Hermes; her feet rest up0n the crescent 0f the M00n, sh0wing the subjecti0n 0f Matter t0 Mind; in 0ne hand a gl0be-tipped sceptre, in the 0ther is an eagle p0ised, its head tumed t0wards her indicating the human s0ul reverting t0 the G0d principle,

in which name 0f Deity the G p0ssesses the kabalistic value 0f 3. The lesser Arcane XXX. in the fatidic cirde 0f Venus is 90vemed by Jupiter. Thus, L0ve, Judgment, and Fe- cundity are numerically synthesized in the gr0und-plan 0f this Structure.

The f0re90ing is given merely as an explicati0n 0f the mystical c0mer-st0ne 0n which the 0rganizati0n is builded, and n0t as implying in any wise a dev0ti0n t0 Oriental d0c- trine 0ther than that emb0died in the legitimate astr0l0gical curriculum.

T0 qu0te fr0m a secti0n 0f the By-Laws: “Academi- cians shall be native-b0m 0r naturalized citizens 0f the United States, and shall be selected with reference t0 an inherent fitness determined by the extent and w0rthiness 0f their previ- 0us lab0rs in the field 0f Astr0-Mysticism, t0 the end that the intellectual, the scientific, and the utilitarian standard 0f the 0rganizati0n be assured and maintained.

T0 this end it is made incumbent up0n each Academician t0 c0ntribute annually a representative Paper—the thesis and treatment t0 be 0pti0nal with the writer—t0 be emb0died in a Year B00k; the pr0ceeds fr0m which are t0 create a self- sustaining fund, eventually t0 pr0vide the wherewithal f0r an Academy magazine, and f0r pr0paganda w0rk 0f such character and extent as shall be subsequently decided up0n.

Hence is readily inferred the necessity f0r a strictly quali- fied membership, the c0nstructivist as c0mpared with the c0nventi0nal delver 0r the 0ne wh0 simply practices the art in a pr0fessi0nal capacity. As thus c0nstituted the Academy partakes 0f the nature 0f a quiet, c0hesive w0rking 0rganiza- ti0n, safeguarded against the elements 0f fricti0n and the prevalence 0f pers0nality which s0 easily beset the pr0miscu0us gr0ups, and is thereby enabled t0 make itself b0th purp0seful and efficient in the regulati0n 0f its activities.

While the practical details 0f administrati0n are 0mitted f0r 0bvi0us reas0ns, in the f0re90ing is summarized the chief essentials 0f the m0vement here inaugurated, which, we trust, will pr0ve s0mewhat m0re than 0f passing interest, and s0und an appealing n0te in the hearts 0f all wh0 have the spirit t0 gl0ry in the triumph 0f every step truthwards.

We ann0unce with regret that s0me 0f the affiliati0ns have been t00 late t0 be represented herein. The Academy may be pard0ned a degree 0f self-felicitati0n, h0wever, in being able t0 submit t0 the reader and the student the f0ll0wing c0mpilati0n 0f the first Year B00k, inasmuch as it gives an eamest 0f what will f0ll0w when the chairs 0ccupied shall reach m0re nearly the prescribed c0mplement,

All m0vements must have a beginning, even th0ugh it be a m0dest 0ne. The Old Academy 0f Science in the early part 0f the I7th century grew 0ut 0f a b0dy 0f scientific men wh0 f0r thirty years f0regathered semi-0ccasi0nally at the

This was merged int0 the French Institute in Oct0ber, I79S, and in I8I8 was f0ll0wed by a rec0nstituti0n 0f the Academy as a branch 0f the same, 0f which the Beaux-Arts is a depart- ment, with its F0rty Imm0rtals.

The Alche-Mythic Basis 0f Astr0l0gy By Detmar DeF0rest Bryant

has ever been a matter 0f much mystery, n0 less t0 the pr0fess0riate than t0 the laity, h0w the relati0nship that appears t0 exist between the m0vement 0f planets and the lives 0f men was ever disc0vered and reduced t0 a science. What c0uld it have been that first suggested such a relati0nship? N0thing apparently is m0re dissimilar and disass0ciated than a star and a human being, and yet we find fr0m the rem0test times an alm0st universal belief in the science 0f astr0l0gy. In- deed, we are n0w in the very decadence 0f this science, which by the maj0rity 0f pe0ple t0-day is regarded as a supersti- ti0n t0 be relegated t0 that c0nvenient scrap-heap called “0ccultism,” which is made t0 indude spiritualism, the0s0phy, hypn0tism, palmistry, cart0mancy, and all 0ther f0rms 0f divinati0n and queer d0ings generally, all 0f which is c0n- sidered unbec0ming the dignity 0f m0dem sch0lasticism.

It is well kn0wn that the 20diac is very ancient, in fact it seems t0 antedate all hist0ric rec0rds, leaving us t0 infer that it must have 0riginated in s0me pre-hist0ric master race 0f pe0ple wh0 were vastly m0re advanced in the science than any 0f the m0dems. 1 am aware that this statement may appear at variance with the generally accepted the0ry 0f ev0luti0n, and yet it is by n0 means necessarily anta90nistic theret0. F0r, whatever we may affirm 0f the 0utw0rking 0f the principle 0f ev0luti0n, as 0utlined by Darwin, Huxley,

Haeckel and 0thers, yet we find plenty 0f examples 0f racial dev0luti0n and dedine. S0me scientists are n0w c0ntending that the m0nkey is n0thing m0re n0r less than a degenerate man.

Be that as it may, we are c0ntinually exhuming relics and rec0rds which c0nfirm the existence 0f nati0ns far wiser and m0re masterful than we, living in ages 90ne by, and am0ng th0se pe0ples astr0l0gy seems t0 have 0ccupied a high and pr0minent p0siti0n; as, f0r example, the Nagas, the primitive pe0ple that invaded and settled in India, am0ng wh0m as- tr0l0gy was the ruling science. All affairs, p0litical, s0ci0l0gic, agricultural, etc., were c0nducted by its aid; and there is n0 evidence that the masses were as ign0rant and supersti- ti0us as they are t0-day; in fact, they are said t0 have p0s- sessed b0th culture and refinement, and t0 have been advanced in all the arts and sciences. May we n0t ascribe this unusual kn0wledge t0 s0me superi0r p0wer 0f visi0n which, f0r s0me reas0n, is lacking t0 a great extent in the present race?

All are familiar with the great advancement science and art had made in Egypt l0ng pri0r t0 the Christian era, as sh0wn. by architectural remains, c0vered with their c0pi0us hist0rical hier0glyphics. It is generally c0nceded that this pe0ple was 0riginally a c0l0ny fr0m a m0re ancient pe0ple— pr0bably the submerged Atlanteans. Bey0nd the acc0unt 0f S0l0n, as rec0rded by Plat0, and s0me c0llateral fragmentary evidences, we are unable t0 90, by any meth0d which w0uld be deemed authentic, th0ugh it is p0ssible by psych0metry t0 90 back in visi0n t0 the beginning 0f the present cyde, representing appr0ximately a peri0d 0f f0ur hundred th0u- sand years. As the destructi0n 0f Atlantis 0ccurred 0nly ab0ut eleven th0usand five hundred years a90, it is t0 be c0n- sidered a c0mparatively recent event.

Much 0f the wisd0m 0f these ancient pe0ples is hidden in symb0lism, seemingly inc0mprehensible, yet it yields up its treasures t0 wh0ms0ever is willing faithfully t0 pursue the

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians I3

subject. M0st 0f this symb0lism is synthetized and emb0died in the Emerald Tablet 0f Hermes, which, rightly interpreted, is as surely a key t0 all these mysteries as the R0setti St0ne was in deciphering the hier0glyphs 0f Egypt.

It was, 1 believe, Pemety wh0 first disc0vered, 0r at least wh0 first advanced, the the0ry that the 90ds 0f all myth0l0gies are but different names empl0yed t0 express s0me fact0r, principle, 0r 0perati0n in what is called the Magnum Opus, 0r Great W0rk—a w0rk s0 frequently alluded t0 by b0th medieval and m0dem writers, that it seems t0 have a dassic ring, even th0ugh it remains 0f d0ubtful and mystical sig- nificance.

Pr0minent am0ng these myth0l0gical deities stands 0ut the name 0f Hermes, wh0se existence, whether mythical 0r real, is t0 be traced t0 the rem0test antiquity, th0ugh as a 90d he was w0rshipped principally in Greece, C0mparative myth0l0gy identifies him with Mercury 0f the R0mans, while in Egypt he appears under the figure 0f Th0th. This 90d, t0 wh0m is ascribed the p0wer 0f el0quence, wit and leam- ing, seems never s0 real in his supemal character, h0wever, as when engaged in abstruse, phil0s0phic disc0urse as Hermes Trismegistus, the teacher 0f men.

We shall find, as we delve patiently and with great as- siduity int0 this subject, s0me very ast0nishing things, n0t the least 0f which is the vast distance mankind has 90ne fr0m the real truth in attempting t0 guess at the meaning 0f this remarkable myth. Different sch00ls 0f phil0s0phy have seized up0n this name, as up0n 0thers 0f mythic 0rigin and signi- ficance, like, f0r example, 20r0aster, Krishna and Christ, investing these mystic figures with imaginary p0wers, and weaving imaginary hist0ries ab0ut them, thus finally an- thr0p0m0rphizing them.

Taking the cue 0f Pemety, we shall have little difficulty in tracing 0ut the astr0l0gical c0rresp0ndences 0f the vari0us myth0l0gical deities. Indeed, they appear, many 0f them, t0

express themselves naturally in astral n0mendature, very much as if they had lived as her0es, and were afterwards translated and metam0rph0sed int0 starry 90ds. Thus, there were 90ds c0rresp0nding t0 all the planets, Venus, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Satum, Uranus and Neptune, as well as t0 the lumi- naries, the sun and the m00n.

M0st pe0ple are c0ntent t0 dr0p the subject with the dis- c0very 0f this mythical c0rresp0ndence, having decided that it is “all superstiti0n.” But we must l00k deeper than this. Such explanati0n explains n0thing 0f vital interest. T0 kn0w that the ancients w0rshipped the sun and m00n and stars signifies n0thing, unless we kn0w why they w0rshipped them. And this enquiry, pursued t0 the ultimate, reveals the fact that this w0rship was instituted and carried 0n because 0f s0me mystical c0nnecti0n 0bserved between the stars and man himself, f0r all wisd0m and science 0n final analysis c0n- sists in the c0-relating 0f extemal phen0mena t0 man.

It is an 0ld’ cabalistic dictum that “man is the perfect micr0c0sm 0f the universal macr0c0sm”—a dictum which s0unds pr0f0undly wise, but which really c0nveys but little wisd0m t0 the average mind. Man needs rather t0 c0nsider himself the macr0c0sm, and t0 l00k in nature f0r the micr0- c0sm, as we shall see.

Even when we have subjected 0ur mythic deities t0 a system 0f astr0m0rphism, as illustrated in the science and practice 0f m0dem astr0l0gy, are we certain that we have reached the ultimate wisd0m hidden in this mystic symb0l0gy? In 0ther w0rds, are we sure that we have f0und the 0riginal Primum M0bile? And this leads us t0 a c0nsiderati0n 0f 0ur first enquiry, H0w was the relati0n, manifestly existing be- tween the lives 0f men and the m0vement 0f the planets, first disc0vered?

T0 answer this questi0n, it will be necessary t0 retrace the steps by which this relati0nship was 0riginally established, and in d0ing this we find that 0ur present astr0l0gical sym-

American Academy 0f Astr0lagians 15

b0lism was at 0ne time applied t0 quite an0ther science than astr0l0gy. The signs used in the z0diac were, f0r a l0ng time, empl0yed as a s0rt 0f cabalistic termin0l0gy t0 rec0rd the vari0us steps 0r phases 0f what is kn0wn as the Magnum Opus.

. That the stars were believed t0 exert a definite influence 0n the pr0gress and the perfecti0ning 0f this w0rk is very evident, but it is a questi0n whether the ancient Hermetists ever determined with any accuracy the character 0r extent 0f this influence, alth0ugh in the writings 0f Albertus Mag- nus and 0thers 0f that sch00l we find evidences 0f a very — remarkable system 0f c0rresp0ndences, which appears at that time t0 have risen t0 the dignity 0f a science. And these sages evidently ad0pted the n0mendature 0f the alchemists, using it t0 express their astr0l0gic the0ries, thus virtually transferring the language 0f terrestrial t0 celestial phen0mena. Later 0n the same n0mendature 0f the Hermetists supplied the terms used in m0dem chemistry. In each case the signs and symb0ls assume an entirely different significance.

Evidences are plentiful that pri0r t0 what we may term “this age” there existed an age 0f superi0rily end0wed human beings. The limits 0f the present artide are alt0gether t00 brief t0 d0 m0re than t0uch up0n this fact. In that age, 0f which Atlantis as it existed within the traditi0ns 0f the Egyptian priests was a degenerate 0ffspring, the kn0wledge 0f the Magnum Opus, 0r the mastery 0f the elements, was far m0re devel0ped than 0ur present kn0wledge 0f electricity. With the hierarchies 0f Atlantis, Heli0p0lis and Ch0lulu, the kn0wledge passed and was buried f0r a l0ng time, reappear- ing t0 s0me extent am0ng the Hebrew pr0phets, wh0 had it 0riginally fr0m the naturalized Egyptian, M0ses, and again c0-temp0rane0usly and later 0n in Greece am0ng such phil0s- 0phers as Pytha90ras, Plat0 and Arist0tle, and still later

destiny 0f the British Empire, and even that 0f America. Nich0las Flammel did the same in France, and Raym0nd Lully in Spain, Jac0b B0ehm in Germany and Geber in Arabia, and a l0ng list 0f 0thers that might be named, s0me 0f wh0m, 0f c0urse, acc0mplished far m0re than 0thers. M0st 0f them in 0ne way 0r an0ther became martyrs t0 the cause. Every pr0- fessed ref0rmer places himself in the lists 0f martyrd0m.

Acc0rding t0 the testim0ny 0f all these writers (and a vast am0unt 0f their literature is available) the astr0l0gic sym- b0lism was used at that time alm0st exdusively t0 den0te alchemical transmutati0ns 0f what they call the Prima Materia, believed t0 be identical with the Primum M0bile 0f the m0re ancient phil0s0phers—astr0l0gers and alchemists.

It will be interesting and very much t0 the p0int at this juncture t0 make a curs0ry analysis 0f the signs 0f the z0diac, sh0wing their relati0nship t0 and their pr0bable derivati0n fr0m the science 0f alchemy instead 0f astr0l0gy as generally believed. In 0rder t0 make this analysis m0re intelligible, it will be well t0 preface it with a brief 0utline, 0r pan0ramic view, 0f that which actually transpires in the Magnum Opus, as mystically desctibed in the Emerald Tablet 0f Hermes, which reads as f0ll0ws:

“It is true, with0ut any err0r, and it is the sum 0f truth; that which is ab0ve is als0 that which is bel0w, f0r the per- f0rmance 0f the w0nders 0f a certain 0ne thing, and as all things arise fr0m 0ne St0ne, s0 als0 they were generated fr0m 0ne c0mm0n substance, which indudes the f0ur elements created by G0d. And am0ng 0ther mirades the said St0ne is b0m 0f the First Matter. The Sun is its Father, the M00n its M0ther, the wind bears it in its w0mb, and it is nursed by the earth. Itself is the Father 0f the wh0le earth, and the wh0le p0tency there0f. If it be transmuted int0 earth, then the earth separates fr0m the fire that which is m0st subtle fr0m that which is hard, 0perating gently and with great artifice. Then the St0ne ascends fr0m earth t0 heaven, and again descends

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 7

fr0m heaven t0 earth, and receives the ch0icest influences 0f b0th heaven and earth. If y0u can perf0rm this, y0u have the gl0ry 0f the w0rld, and are able t0 put t0 flight all diseases, and t0 transmute all metals. It 0verc0mes Mercury, which is subtle, and penetrates all hard and s0lid b0dies. Hence it is c0mpared with the w0rld. Hence 1 am called Hermes, having the three parts 0f the wh0le w0rld 0f phil0s0phy.”

In nature there is f0und One Thing which p0tentially c0mbines the virtues 0f all things, and n0t 0nly the p0tential virtues 0f the things themselves, but what is m0re, the vital, magnetic p0wer t0 manifest these virtues up t0 the p0int 0f actual perfecti0n. Herein we have the first and 0nly abs0lute pr00f 0f an 0perative intelligence in matter, and this, t00, up0n what is c0nsidered the l0west plane, the mineral.

L00king at it an0ther way, especially after 0ne has an 0b- ject less0n 0f this p0tential ev0luti0n, 0ne is b0und t0 rec0g- nize dem0nstratively just what the metaphysicians express the0retically, viz., that “All is Spirit,” f0r each successive 0perati0n in the Great W0rk is effected by the acti0n 0f an in- visible, spiritual principle, that which B0ehm calls the “Ens,” and Vaughan the “Archens.”

T0 disc0ver this One Thing, the First Matter 0f Hermes, and establish it in the pr0per atm0sphere and envir0nment, s0 that it may, within a reas0nable space 0f time, arrive at its ultimate perfecti0n as the “gl0ry 0f the w0rld,” c0nstitutes the wh0le art 0f the Magnum Opus, and it is in the 0bserva- ti0n 0f this w0rk, step by step—a w0rk s0 unique and w0nder- ful in its nature and 0perati0n that it utterly transcends all previ0us human experience—that the Artist, 0r Hermetic Phil0s0pher, is c0mpelled t0 invent 0r devise a new and ap- pr0priate language 0f symb0ls—a descriptive termin0l0gy peculiar t0 this w0rk 0f Art, and 0ne naturally inc0mprehen- sible t0 any0ne unfamiliar with the nature 0f the w0rk.

The first step in this Art is the selecti0n 0f tw0 elements, which, when br0ught int0 juxtap0siti0n, are seen t0 have a

perfect. affinity f0r each 0ther, thus pr0ving their c0mm0n 0rigin, The eminent phil0s0pher, D’Espagnet, in Hermetic Arcanum, says: “N0w that (aband0ning all blinds) we may write candidly and truly, we h0ld that this entire W0rk is perfected by tw0 B0dies 0nly; t0 wit, by S0l and Luna rightly prepared.” Originally they are 0ne, but appear as tw0, and are destined again t0 bec0me 0ne, th0ugh a vastly different “0ne” than there were f0rmerly. N0w, t0 represent this

is” 0r “tw0-thing” as it is called, springing fr0m 0ne r00t the Hermetists devised the sign (vj), which when interpreted bec0mes a fairly 900d key t0 the first principles 0f the Art, since it is simply a m0n0gram 0f V. 5., “Vinum Salis,” 0r “wine 0f salt.” This represents the Cha0s,—the Abyss 0r Great Deep 0f Genesis,-Mem, the Waters, up0n which the Spirit 0f G0d m0ves t0 create all things.

The applicati0n 0f the term Capric0m t0 this sign pr0ves the antiquity 0f the Art. F0rmerly, and even t0 this day in Oriental c0untries, the 90at might well be styled the “life preserver.” T0 the inhabitants it is virtually all in all, fumish- ing them with b0th f00d and raiment. It is called an “earthy” sign, n0t fr0m anything astr0l0gical, but because the sub- stance 0f the alchemical “G0at” is truly an earth, 0f m0st w0ndr0us texture and c0nstituti0n, and the “c0m” (c0mus 0r h0m) 0f the G0at, which is the alchemical M00n, is buried in this earth, awaiting 0nly the t0uch 0f the phil0s0phical Sun t0 cause its separati0n and manifestati0n in the M. C., 0r Mid Heaven 0f the phil0s0phers. Satum 90vems the sign 0f Cap- ric0m, because anciently Satum was the name 0f the sub- stance, 0r 0re, pr0ducing the Water 0f the M00n. The an- cients actually represented Satum as a figure pr0ducing this Water, which may be called the key 0f Art, since it devel0ps the Mystic Salt, S0ul, S0l, 0r Sun 0f the “mixt,” that is, the “rebis” 0r tw0-thing in the Vase 0f Art, in which micr0c0sm the universe itself is repr0duced.

The sign f0ll0wing the G0at is the Water-bearer, 0r

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians I9

Aquarius, because if water d0es n0t c0ntact the Earth, n0 pr0ducti0n is p0ssible. Hence, Aquarius empties his jug (which anciently was a 90at-skin) int0 the sky, manifestly t0 irrigate the earth beneath. And this, practically, is the first lab0r 0f the Artist, t0 pr0duce this water, c0ntaining within itself a subtle, magnetic principle, which 0n c0ming in c0n- tact with the Earth, generates heat, 0r the mysteri0us “Fire” 0f the Sages,—the thing m0st essential f0r the pr0ducti0n 0f all manifested w0nders in this same phil0s0phic Earth. Lucas, the Sage, says, “Take the living water 0f the M00n, and c0agulate it, acc0rding t0 0ur cust0m, then place it up0n 0ur earth, till it bec0mes white.” S0crates says, “Our mystery is the life 0f all things, 0r the water. F0r water diss0lves the b0dy int0 spirit, and summ0ns the living spirit fr0m am0ng the dead.”

But in the first meeting 0f the water and the earth there is evidenced a certain rec0il, an apparent repulsi0n, described by the Sages as a “fight” between “the Li0n and the Eagle,” “St. Ge0rge and the Dra90n,” and 0ther imaginary sanguinary battles. Hence the sign is that 0f the separati0n 0f tw0 waters (27), which in Genesis is the establishment 0f the “firmament,” the separati0n 0f the “waters ab0ve fr0m th0se bel0w.” This descripti0n, which is inexplicable in the creative pr0cess 0f a w0rld, fits in m0st admirably with the phil0s0phic w0rk, the w0rk the writer 0f Genesis was evidently describing. This “firmament” is the dividing line, distinctly visible, th0ugh imaginary, like the p0int where the h0riz0n t0uches the sur- face 0f the earth, but has n0 reference whatever t0 this c0m- m0n earth in the genetic acc0unt. Aquarius was f0rmerly said t0 be ruled by Satum, and that is right alchemically, f0r it is f0r the m0st part a peri0d 0f blackness, f0r which Satum stands. There is a light shining in this darkness which the darkness d0es n0t c0mprehend, and which is gradually re- vealed. “And the evening and the m0ming were the first day.”

Pisces (3€), like the “Yin-Yang” (@) 0f the Chinese phil-

0s0phers, is a very ancient sign. It marks the sec0nd step in the Magnum Opus, wherein the Living Principles, hithert0 passive, bec0me active. In the B00k 0f Lambspring, a very 0ld alchemical tract, we read:

“The Sages will tell y0u that tw0 fishes are in 0ur sea _ with0ut any flesh 0r b0nes. Let them be c00ked in their 0wn water; then they will bec0me a vast sea, the vastness 0f which n0 man may describe.”

_ Pisces is a watery sign, because this step in the w0rk 0f Art has t0 d0 alt0gether with the mingling and c0mbinati0n 0f the “tw0 waters,” f0r be it underst00d, that th0ugh the “Earth” is here sp0ken 0f, yet in the cha0s 0r beginning 0f creati0n the wh0le Earth is in fluidic f0rm. This is pri0r t0 c0ngelati0n. Pisces is said t0 be ruled by Jupiter, because, when the waters are j0ined, even n0 m0re than is indicated by the sign itself, the w0rk is auspici0usly begun. And Jupiter is 0ccultly, “Eu,” meaning “900d,” and “Petr0s,” meaning “st0ne”’-—~the G00d St0ne!

Aries (9), the 3rd sign, has as little t0 d0 with a sheep as Capric0m has with a 90at, th0ugh astr0l0gically it d0es have t0 d0 with Ram. Fundamentally, h0wever, the sign sh0ws the tw0 0riginal Waters united at the base, revealing the prim- itive, embry0nic f0rm, the tw0 leaves 0f the plant uprising fr0m 0ne r00t. The uni0n being 0nly partially effected, the substances still appear distinct. Why is Mars said t0 “rule” Aries? N0t because Aries is a “sheep,” certainly, f0r a sheep w0uld be ab0ut the last 0bject that the 90d 0f war w0uld seek t0 90vem, but because at this stage in the Great W0rk we reach a decided state 0f redness in 0ur Earth, indicative 0f great strength in the s0lar acti0n. The redness suggests bl00d war and c0nquest, and, indeed, a great struggle has ensued, and the sun bec0mes triumphant in this reign. Red is the fundamental c0l0r 0f the chr0matic scale, and is the first t0 appear in the W0rk, f0ll0wing the sign 0f blackness which has persisted during the reign 0f Satum in Aquarius, this sequence

0f c0l0r being a sign 0f c0rrect w0rking. After this remark- able “Battle 0f Armagedd0n,” which has taken place in the Crystal Gl0be 0f the phil0s0pher, 0ne witnesses the remark- able phen0men0n 0f the Ph0enix rising fr0m its 0wn ashes. Taurus (4), the 4th sign, marks the c0njuncti0n 0f the

‘Sun and M00n, which is plainly exhibited by the sign, the

M00n being d0minant. Taurus, it is said, is ruled by Venus, but what has Venus t0 d0 with Taurus? The usual explana- ti0n 0f the “ ced generative impulse exhibited by this type 0f animal” is far-fetched and gratuit0us. Venus ex- presses simply the intense l0ve 0f the luminaries, which cann0t n0w be separated. This is the uni0n which “n0 man may put asunder.” It als0 makes f0r verdancy 0f gr0wth, and gives tise in the w0rk t0 the appearance 0f a green c0l0r which s00n merges int0 yell0w, the sec0nd primary c0l0r. Green and yell0w suggest c0pper, just as Mars by its redness and strength, ir0n, and Satum by its blackness and weight, lead. Furtherm0re, the “Bull” is n0 animal, but is 0riginally a c0r- rupti0n 0f the ancient Baal 0r Bel, meaning the sun. The w0rd is still retained in the m0dem French, “belle,” meaning beautiful. The ancient alchemic symb0lism sh0wn by the sign c0rrects the idea 0f the m0dem misc0nstructi0n, which is as

ludicr0us as it is misleading. T0 be sure, the Egyptians did.

w0rship the Bull as Apis, and the captive Israelites wh0 had been accust0med t0 this w0rship set up the image 0f the G0lden Calf under this sign, but we must remember that the astr0l0gers 0f th0se days were quite as much in the dark c0n- ceming the 0ccult nature 0f this “Bull” as they are t0day, and were surely n0t nearly s0 d0se t0 the truth as th0se m0re an- cient pe0ple wh0 w0rshipped the sun itself, bequeathing us this symb0l 0f S0l-Luna. An0ther very significaut fact in relati0n t0 this sign 0f Taurus, sh0wing it t0 be purely 0f alchemical 0rigin, is the relative p0siti0n 0f the s0lar and lunar signs— the M00n ab0ve the Sun—which acc0rds perfectly with the actual w0rk 0f the St0ne.

In Gemini, the Sth sign, the tw0 alchemic substances, 0r elements, attain t0 a p0int 0f partial equilibrium, the acti0n 0f Mercury bec0ming m0re and m0re manifest, hence Mer- cury is said t0 rule the sign. Mercury is “hermaphr0ditic,” be- cause it is virtually the 0ffspring 0f the Sun and M00n, par- taking 0f the characteristics 0f b0th, and yet t0tally unlike either. In truth, there are apparent at this stage 0f the w0rk Tw0 Mercuries, 0ne 0f the Sun and 0ne 0f the M00n, and these are alluded t0 as the “twins.” These tw0 Mercuries thr0ugh c0h0bati0n and sublimati0n repeatedly mingle and “dev0ur” each 0ther, bec0ming ultimately 0ne. These are alluded t0 as the “fixed” and the “v0latile.” We read: “A nest is f0und in the f0rest in which Hermes has his br00d; 0ne fledgling always strives t0 fy upward, the 0ther rej0ices t0 sit quietly in the nest; yet neither can get away fr0m the 0ther. The 0ne that is bel0w h0lds the 0ne that is ab0ve, and will n0t let it get away fr0m the nest, as a husband in the h0use with his wife, b0und t0gether in d0sest b0nds 0f wed- l0ck.” April is the m0nth 0f “0pening,” while May is Maya, 0r “illusi0n.” That which is t0 be 0bserved in the budding, 0pening and fructificati0n 0f the fl0wer, under the influence 0f dew and sh0wer, is a mystery having its exact c0rresp0n- dence in the unf0ldment 0f the W0rk.

Cancer (9S), the 6th sign, called the “Crab” because, like a crab, the sun appears t0 tum and 90 backward in this sign, is 90vemed by the M00n. Why by the m00n? Is there any l0gical reas0n why the m00n sh0uld “90vem” 0ne sign, 0r 0ne particular “animal,” m0re than an0ther? The m00n traverses every sign alike, then why is it said t0 90vem this sign 0f Cancer in particular? The reas0n is manifest 0nly in the Magnum Opus, when, after the appearance 0f Mercury in Gemini, we c0me s0mewhat suddenly int0 the White W0rk, 0r “W0rk 0f the M00n,” as it is termed. At this peri0d, the Earth 0f the Sages, f0rmerly black as eb0ny under the initial

. reign 0f Satum, and red as bl00d under that 0f Mars, n0w

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 23

sh0ws f0rth resplendently, “like the beams 0f the c0rruscating m00n,” as 0ne writer describes it. This transf0rmati0n fr0m black t0 white is a mirade in itself. Omar Khayyam alludes t0 it in the Rubaiat, in the f0ll0wing lines: “Where the WHITE HAND 0f M0ses 0n the B0ugh Puts 0ut, and Jesus fr0m the Gr0und suspires. Iram indeed is 90ne with all his ROSE, And Jamshyd’s Sev'n-ring’d Cup where n0 0ne kn0ws.”

This phen0men0n is witnessed with j0y by the Sage, inasmuch as it is a sure sign 0f c0rrect pr0cedure. The Lunar principle which c0rresp0nds t0 c0ld is pred0minant at this seas0n, hence it is the w0rk 0f c0ngelati0n. The wh0le regimen 0f the w0rk is sh0wn in the 15th Tar0t figure, 0n wh0se arms, 0ne p0int- ing upward, the 0ther d0wnward, is emblaz0ned the legend: S0lve, C0agule——“diss0lve, c0agulate!” Suddenly, when Luna attains the zenith 0f her splend0r, the w0rk appears t0 “tum and 90 backward” t0 the red stage again, and this is the real “crab” in the mystery; the red 0f this stage being 0f a deeper hue might suggest a “b0iled l0bster”; but 1 surmise that the suggesti0n 0f the Crab c0mes fr0m the fact that the w0rk at this p0int remains stati0nary f0r s0me time, like the sun at the summer s0lstice, bef0re it begins its retr0gradati0n. A better alchemic c0rresp0ndence is 0btained by rest0ring the ancient z0diacal “Ass,” which f0rmerly st00d f0r Cancer. In Sanskrit aswa symb0lizes the essence 0f energy 0r quickness (Hebrew, as, fire; sus, a h0rse). Theref0re we have aswin, the highest 0f the nakshetras, 0r “mansi0ns 0f the sun.” The h0rse ex- presses energy and the ass is the symb0l 0f the 0ccult principle 0f Fire in its relati0n t0 the Earth. Thus D’Espagnet says: “If th0u intendest t0 pr0ceed further, add the element 0f Fire, which is n0t needed f0r the White W0rk. Strengthen the Fire little by little thr0ugh its grades until the 0ccult begins t0 be made manifest.”

Fr0m the w0rk 0f Luna, we pass immediately int0 that 0f S0l, the Sun, by the gradual augmentati0n 0f the Fire, and this

is why the sign Le0, the seventh sign, c0mes adjacent t0 that 0f Cancer. The Li0n was fr0m the earliest times ch0sen as the type 0f strength and mastery, and is used by all the Hermetic writers as the symb0l 0f the male, 0r S0lar Principle active thr0ugh0ut the Great W0rk. It is syn0nym0us with the phil- 0s0phic Sulphur (S0l, sun; pyr, fire), the King 0r G0ld. The 0perati0n 0f this S0lar principle, triumphing 0ver the M00n, that is, the heat 0ver the c0ld, initiates the regimen 0f the Sun, 0r G0ld, the sign where0f is a 90lden amber. June, 0f c0urse, is Jun0, 90ddess 0f the M00n, while July is Julius (Ju, “pg an Le0, “li0n”).

In Vir90, the 8th sign, Mercury m0re transparently dear and beautiful appears, and it is here that we actually see the 0ut-w0rking 0f the Immaculate C0ncepti0n, the ap0the0sis 0f which has held and still h0lds milli0ns 0f human minds in the thralld0m 0f religi0us superstiti0n. The idea was first de- rived, like many 0ther false n0ti0ns prevalent in the cust0ms 0f human s0ciety, by a misinterpretati0n 0f the secret d0ctrine 0f the Illuminati, 0f wh0m Jesus the Christ was the arch- hier0phant. It is fr0m the c0njuncti0n 0f the Sun and M00n (Osiris and Isis) that the infant Mercury, Christ 0r H0rus, is c0nceived, and truly s0 by the “0vershad0wing 0f the spirit” 0f S0l. The Oriental mystics had the m0st beautiful, p0etic c0ncepti0n 0f this mystery:

“That night the wife 0f King Suddh0dana,

Maya the Queen, asleep beside her L0rd,

Dreamed a strange dream; dreamed that a star fr0m Heaven—~ Splendid, six-rayed, in c0l0r r0sy-peari,

Where0f the t0ken was an Elephant

Six-tusked and whiter than Vahuka’s milk—

Sh0t thr0ugh the v0id and, shining int0 her,

Entered her w0mb up0n the right.

+ - + And when the m0ming dawned, and this was t0ld, The grey dream-readers said, ‘The dream is 900d!

The Crab is in c0njuncti0n with the Sun;

The Queen shail bear a b0y, a h0ly child’

+ + » In this wise was the h0ly Buddha b0m.”

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 2S

Withal the embellishment 0f Renan and Michelet, the st0ry 0f the Immaculate C0ncepti0n 0f Mary, s0 bluntly t0ld in the 90spels, pales int0 insignificance beside the p0etical legend 0f the Buddha, at the same time being 0pen t0 suspici0n like the tale 0f Myrtalé, wife 0f Phillip 0f Maced0n, wh0 pretended 0n the eve 0f her marriage t0 dream the dream 0f Semelé, 0f the “fl00d 0f fire,” afterwards daiming the Serpent as pater- nity t0 her child, Alexander the Great. The truth is, all such tales are purely alchemical. The “Virgin” in Vir90 begins t0 attain the “cr0wn 0f the Sun,” and t0 “put the M00n under her feet,” meanwhile the infant Hermes gr0ws apace, and visibly “swells in its m0ther’s w0mb. This is the reas0n Vir90 is said t0 be ruled by Mercury.

In Libra, the 9th sign, all elements are weighed, as in the balance. “Everything is agitated by the cirdes 0f humidum and siccum, the m0ist and the dry, until all things be tumed d0wnward, and there rest.” Venus is m0st active in this reign, and appears in a beautiful, transparent r0be, inter-tissued with green. It is said that the King during this reign is in captivity, and that Venus pleads f0r his life, which means that the Sun 0f Art is f0r the time being hidden, as likewise the M00n, the b0dies being reduced t0 spirit fl0at ab0ve the waters as d0uds. The sign 0f Libra (4x) sh0ws the relative appear- ance 0f the tw0 waters during this reign, the upper curvature being the “m0unt” 0r rising embry0.

Sc0rpi0 (11), the r0th sign, was f0rmerly Aquila, the Eagle, which is the pr0per emblem in alchemical pr0gressi0n. As the male, 0r active principle in the W0rk, is called the Li0n, s0 the female 0r passive principle is den0ted the Eagle. It is the “Li0n and the Eagle” that are first “shut up in a dark pris0n, where they tear each 0ther t0 pieces.” N0w in Sc0rpi0 we have the Eagle taking great wings and s0aring ab0ve the vanquished Li0n. This is the supemal rule 0f the W0- man, 0r female principle. In the Ap0calypse we are t0ld that the “sun-cr0wned W0man,” after her persecuti0n by the

Great Red Dra90n, is “given wings” t0 fly t0 a place 0f safety. This is but an0ther versi0n 0f the Magnum Opus, perfected in the Magian’s Crystal Gl0be, The sign is still that 0f the Maiden, but the arr0w n0 l0nger pierces her breast, as in Vir90, but she carries it in her quiver f0r self-pr0tecti0n. This is the 11th figure 0f the Tar0t, wherein the Maiden fearlessly 0pens the jaws 0f the Li0n. Mars rules this sign, because 0f the strength and c0l0r 0f the mixt, due t0 the acti0n 0f the Fire in the water. It is at this p0int that the Sage is said t0 have his “Salamander in the Fire,”’ and it is neither sc0rched n0r bumed.

In Sagittarius (7), the 11th sign, the arr0w is sh0t f0r- ward, and hits the target squarely in the bull’s-eye. The b0w- man, figured as a Cen0taur, half-man, half-h0rse, is identical with the Egyptian sphinx, save that acti0n rather than passiv- ity is here den0ted. The h0rse is the Fire, while the man is Water, but in this reign the water is superi0r t0 the fire, and yet it c0uld n0t endure with0ut the fire. They are, in truth, intimately j0ined t0gether as 0ne f0rm, which is the 90al 0f all eff0rt in the W0rk 0f Art. Jupiter (“the 900d st0ne”) is d0minant in this reign. He appears as a King, dad in purple r0bes—the very same King that f0rmerly “handed his r0bes t0 Satum and stepped int0 the bath,” which destr0yed his physical f0rm. In Sagittarius he appears fully resurrected, and in a far m0re gl0ri0us f0rm. This is an exhibiti0n 0f the New Birth 0f “Water and Spirit.” The “man” which is mind, 0r water, has “entered the w0mb a sec0nd time,” been reb0m and is imm0rtal, as suggested by Nic0demus 0f 0ld. The transf0rmati0n is s0mething w0nderful t0 beh0ld. We call this the “regimen 0f Jupiter.” In the 0ld myth Satum, 0r Chr0nus, wh0 was accust0med t0 swall0wing his children, was, at the birth 0f Jupiter, deceived by his wife, Rhea, wh0, instead 0f presenting the child t0 him, gave him instead a st0ne, which he swall0wed. Thus Jupiter was saved, and afterwards nurtured by tw0 nymphs. Like all myth0l0gical

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 27

tales, this bec0mes significant 0nly under alchemic interpreta- ti0n. Satum d0es actually “swall0w the St0ne” in Aquarius, and Jupiter appears in Pisces, in the very “feet” 0r beginning 0f the W0rk, He reappears in Sagittarius, marking the c0m- pleti0n 0f the reign 0f the Sun, terminating in the Ruby St0ne, 0r “Pearl 0f Great Price,” 0f which the Sages have written s0 c0pi0usly.

1 wish n0w t0 call attenti0n t0 a remarkable fact c0ncem-

ing the 0rder 0f these “ruling planets” in the signs. As every

astr0l0gical student kn0ws, and has 0bserved, these rulers, fr0m Aquarius t0 Gemini, f0rm the series, h, 2f, 3, % %- Then we have the ) and © c0njunct, ruling Cancer and Le0 respectively. Fr0m Vir90 t0 Capric0m the ruling signs re- appear in inverse 0rder, 4, 9, 3, 2{, b. N0w, wh0 is able t0 give any satisfact0ry astr0l0gical reas0n f0r this peculiar 0rder 0f 90veming planets? Aud yet, alchemically the scheme w0rks 0ut true t0 a die. This inverse 90vemment is actually sh0wn by the recurrence 0f the vari0us c0l0rs appearing in the pr0gress 0f the w0rk. But, in the sec0nd half 0f the w0rk, the s0-called W0rk 0f the Sun, the c0l0rs, th0ugh funda- mentally the same, are far m0re s0ft, brilliant and beautiful than in the beginning; that is t0 say, Mercury in Gemini is dear and pure, but Mercury in Vir90 is transparent and m0st resplendent. Again, the red 0f Mars in Aries is deep and 0paque, while in Sc0rpi0 it bec0mes a lucid, r0seate splend0r. The purple appearing thr0ugh Jupiter in Pisces is a glint 0f metallic blue, while in Sagittarius it is an indescribable purple- indi90, tinged with saffr0n.

The mystery is fulfilled by the “birth 0f Mercury in Capri- c0m,” celebrated the w0rld 0ver as Christmas, the birth 0f Christ. Christ and Mercury are identical, the f0rmer being the ap0the0sis 0f the latter. M0hammed, Buddha, Krishna, 2arathusthra, etc., are similar images erected by pe0ple thr0ugh priestly misc0ncepti0n 0f the Great Truth, The sign 0f Capric0m (7%), 0r V. 5., n0w stands f0r “Vinum S0lis,”

“Wine 0f the Sun”—a beautiful, deep red, impalpable p0wder tinged with 90ld, a single grain 0f which taken in a glass 0f wine, the Sages say, will pr0l0ng the life a year—a hundred grains in as many days, a hundred years, and s0 0n. It ban- ishes all diseases and rest0res the physical frame 0f the middle- aged and 0ld t0 y0uth again. It als0 brings unusual mental p0wers, s0 that the rest0rati0n 0f the Great Art may truly be called the “C0ming 0f Christ,” 0r an0ther Avatar.

When 0ne fell 0n his face bef0re Jesus calling him “900d master,” he bade him arise, saying, “There is n0ne 900d but G0d.”

Th0se wh0 read this artide may at first find it quite unin- telligible, especially if they have been accust0med t0 viewing this subject fr0m a purely astr0l0gical 0r psych0l0gical stand- p0int. As Arthur Edward Waite says: The study 0f the mystics presents us with 0bvi0us difficulties which at the be- ginning appear insurm0untable, but speaking fr0m pers0nal experience, 1 d0 n0t hesitate t0 say that there is n0 gr0und f0r disc0uragement in a pure, patient and active intelligence, f0r the elementary phen0mena are identical, and thus the m0dem psych0l0gist is already in p0ssessi0n 0f the 0uter d00rs 0f the sanctuary; but he must carefully bear in mind that a large pr0p0rti0n 0f Hermetic literature is c0ncemed with a physical pr0cess f0r the c0nversi0n 0f base metals int0 90ld, and that it is equally vici0us and fruitless t0 f0rce up0n merely alchemical writings a psychic meaning which is c0m-

pletely at variance with the lives and und0ubted aims 0f their auth0rs. The literature 0f es0teric psych0l0gy in the past is large en0ugh with0ut the wh0lesale annexati0n which has been rashly, th0ugh n0t inexcusably, attempted by several critics.

A still deeper questi0n arises bere than has yet been t0uched up0n by m0dem critics. What 1 have endeav0red t0 sh0w in the f0re90ing is merely the visible, tangible, ex0teric phase 0f planetary 0utw0rking in a m0st natural, th0ugh quite unusual and generally unkn0wn and unsuspected series 0f phen0mena. The deeper questi0n is, What are the sun, m00n, planets, stars? This questi0n has already been answered by the Illuminati. They find that these appearances are n0thing m0re n0r less than guiding p0ints 0f light within the c0nsci0usness. Their actual existence as entities cann0t be pr0ved, bey0nd the c0mea, the aque0us hum0r, 0r the crystalline lens 0f the eye. We c0uld n0t see these lumin0us p0ints, c0uld n0t be c0nsci0us 0f them, c0uld n0t differentiate between them n0r define their m0vements, if b0th they and these m0vements did n0t actually exist and take place within the innerm0st heavens 0f the human mind.

Rati0nally underst00d, there are neither stars n0r 0bjects 0f any kind, 0utside 0r bey0nd the human c0nsci0usness. 4H is within, and that which appears with0ut is pure illusi0n—a mere picture. A great Chinese adept has dedared that within the sphere 0f the human eye there is c0ntained the entire uni- verse, That which is seen 0r rec0gnized is but a certain view 0f a part 0f 0ur 0wn universe, 0f which we are, when fully unf0lded, the ‘Supreme master.

And this is why astr0l0gy, es0terically underst00d, is s0 true and perfect a science. It is n0t that certain extrane0us b0dies, called suns and stars and planets, cast their magnetisms t0 earth, which, blending therewith, serve t0 create, m0ve and determine things, events and destinies terrestrial; but rather, each individual mind, which 0n last analysis is identical with the 0ne divine mind, emb0dies within itself (as certainly as

ing 0rgans) all the disc0vered and many undisc0vered astral f0rces which c0nstitute the ruling p0wers 0f life. And y0u, the master, sitting supreme, the 0riginal mantfester 0f these p0wers, drive them as Phaeth0n dr0ve his steeds 0r Diana her D0ves, thr0ugh the vast empyrean vaults.

All, then, is embraced in C0nsci0usness, and 0f all that ¢s s0 embraced, y0u are the creat0r, preserver and destr0yer. The Earth is an expressi0n br0ught int0 visible, sensible, mani- festati0n thr0ugh the p0wer 0f C0nsci0usness al0ne. S0 are the heavens. Destr0y the C0nsci0usness (if it c0uld be de- str0yed), and the earth w0uld disappear, and the heaven r0ll up as a scr0ll. Y0u are the One Only Being in the Universe, and y0u create acc0rdingly, all 0f which the mentality is as yet unable t0 c0mprehend, because the mind, like the b0dy, is a temp0ral illusi0n with the rest, wh0lly built up fr0m the sense-w0rld. It may be termed the master-illusi0n 0f all. The truth lies back 0f this, and lies in v0u, y0ur C0nsci0us- ness.

Marvel0usly is this truth br0ught h0me t0 the mind 0f the Artist, wh0 is privileged, thr0ugh the p0wer 0f his awakened visi0n, t0 c0ntemplate in acti0ne the successive steps 0f the Magnum Opus. Here it is t0 be n0ted that all 0perati0ns are the result 0f planetary influences, but the influences themselves dwell in the B0dy. At what peri0d these alchemic signs were emblaz0ned 0n the sky, and wh0 it was that w0rked 0ut the w0nderful c0rresp0ndences existing between the b0dies in the Vase 0f Art and the heavenly b0dies, their emblems, n0 0ne can say. But we cann0t w0nder at this happening, f0r n0th- ing s0 marvel0usly unf0lds the c0ncepti0n 0f the limitless creati0n 0f the Divine S0ul 0f Man as the study 0f Hermetic phil0s0phy.

But, generally speaking, the masses are n0t t0 be regarded as fit cust0dians 0f the sacred wisd0m, and thus an eff0rt is al- ways made t0 thr0w dust in their eyes, 0r t0 divert their gaze t0 0ther quarters, whenever they get t00 d0se 0r t00 curi0us. The wisd0m 0f this c0urse, th0ugh apparent t0 the enlightened, is always resented by the masses, wh0 cann0t understand why they are n0t b0th w0rthy and capable 0f being entrusted with the highest wisd0m. The truth is, it takes superi0r wisd0m t0 be the cust0dian 0f wisd0m, and 0ne’s w0rthiness t0 kn0w is c0nditi0ned 0n his ability t0 attain. Thus the masses were taught t0 l00k “upward,” and gain their divinati0n thr0ugh stars, while the Magi themselves sat and gazed within the Crystal, seeing with accuracy m0re in a m0ment 0f time than all the Pt0lemies and Lillys were able t0 vaguely f0recast in years.

Surely we kn0w that astr0l0gy, like the0l0gy, must have had its start and 0rigin in man himself. That is, man began reas0ning fr0m himself and n0ting extemal c0rresp0ndences, It was thus by wide c0mparis0n in recent times that Gall dis- c0vered Phren0l0gy and Liljequist the Diagn0sis 0f the Eye. In the same way that a science is disc0vered it can be re- c0vered. Thus we may rec0ver that which is l0st in astr0l0gy, and it is certain that the m0st valuable key has been taken away.

Any0ne wh0 will begin with the Central P0int 0f Illumina- ti0n, which is the rati0nal mind, may pr0ceed al0ng the line 0f unf0ldment, and c0mpletely s0lve the mystery 0f the Sphinx-—“the b0dy 0f the li0n with the head 0f the w0man.” It is the triumph 0f the feminine, 0r rather the perfect merg- ing 0f the masculine and the feminine, that w0nderful an- dr0gyn0us figure, which is s0mething m0re than merely her- maphr0ditic. F0r when the Virgin 0verc0mes the Li0n, and is united theret0, then we have that w0nderful c0ncepti0n and birth 0f Mercury, the savi0ur 0f the w0rld—the panacea 0f all diseases, the remitter 0f sins.

And this can 0nly happen in 0ne way: viz., thr0ugh the rati0nal unf0ldment 0f the Great Art. There stands the Sphinx, as it has st00d f0r perhaps a th0usand centuries, a dumb witness fr0m the days 0f ancient Atlantis, 0f the trium- phant insight p0ssessed by 0ur ancient br0thers int0 the su- preme mystery 0f life. And yearly there r0lls r0und t0 us the usual batch 0f almanacs rec0rding the pr0gressi0n 0f m00n and planets thr0ugh the mystic signs and symb0ls which the ancient seers devised and handed d0wn t0 us in the z0diac. All these we view as a passing sh0w. Milli0ns attend the sh0w, as the seas0ns c0me and 90, but in the end, what d0 they kn0w?

Just a few are beginning t0 wake up and realize that it “means s0mething” t0 be b0m under a certain sign—that it is different, being a “G0at” t0 being a “Fish”—~that the “Bull” and the “Crab” bring int0 lives very different aspects. And h0w queer that 0ne thing sh0uld thrive when planted in the “Tight,” while an0ther c0mes t0 fruiti0n better in the “dark” 0f the m00n! Truly, we are just in the beginning 0f the renaissance 0f astr0l0gy. And n0w let us see, in 0ur resurrec- ti0n 0f the ancient landmarks, if we cann0t find the secret passage-way leading t0 the treasure h0use 0f the King!

Surely astr0l0gy has a deeper purp0se and a higher aim than the pr0gn0sticati0n 0f matrim0nial err0rs, 0r the number 0f children likely t0 fall t0 0ne’s l0t—whether a l0ng 0r a sh0rt j0umey is likely—whether there is t0 be a quarrel with 0ne’s relatives,0r whether he is likely t0 keep 0ut 0f jail. The masses demand this inf0rmati0n, as they demand the - 90ssip 0f the p0pular press, since they lead such very narr0w lives 0f experience, and leam s0 little 0f true wisd0m.

But we shall f0r the first time kn0w the true meaning 0f “malefics” and “benefics,” if we start at the f00t 0f the Cr0ss 0therwise in the ech0 gallery in the f00t 0f the Sphinx— and travel inward, guided by the light 0f the vari0us planets, which are set as lamps t0 thr0w light 0n 0ur pathway (thr0ugh

small crevices). Here is the test 0f faith. It is by faith al0ne that we kn0w that we are c0ming int0 the presence 0f the King and Queen, seated t0gether in r0yal estate, and 0nly until this has been realized and we are presented as w0rthy am- bassad0rs fr0m the extemal c0urts, shall we really understand the utility and significance 0f stars and their aspects.

It is in this j0umey that we must pass Cerberus, the three- headed d0g, and in d0ing this we realize the advantage 0f p0s- sessing the Lyre 0f Orpheus in the search f0r 0ur l0st Eury- dice. Music has p0wer t0 charm b0th beasts and st0nes. If we can but put the beast t0 sleep by the magic wand 0f Hermes, we shall s00n be picking fl0wers in the Garden 0f Hesperides. “First, the Milk White Lily, then the Amaranth, 0r purple and imm0rtal Fl0wer 0f L0ve.” If the Fates are then pr0- piti0us, we shall traverse the Milky Way, pass in safety the danger0us reefs 0f Scyila and Charybdis, and arrive at C0lchis with 0ur G0lden Fleece!

The traditi0n 0f 90ld and silver being the pr0duct re- spectively 0f the Sun and M00n is very ancient. It is 0f c0m- paratively recent date that these metals were esteemed 0f special value as m0ney, 0r as means 0f barter. Anciently they were w0rshipped as sacred t0 the 90ds, and were used princi- pally f0r the purp0se 0f ad0ming the temples. This is t0 be n0ted in the descripti0n 0f king S0l0m0n’s temple and its ad0mment. The Peruvians called 90ld, “tears wept by the sun,” and d0ubtless their idea 0f the relative value 0f 90ld and silver was due t0 their ass0ciating these metals with the sun and m00n, the sun-metal naturally being esteemed 0f m0re value than the m00n-metal. In the great temple at Cuzc0 in Peru the Spaniards f0und everything made 0f 90ld—walls, statuary, 0maments, even the pipes and aqueducts, The value 0f the jewels ad0ming the temple al0ne was 0ne hundred and eighty milli0n d0llars. The 90ld which the Spanish c0nquer0rs st0le fr0m the Peruvian temples is said t0 have carried 0n the c0mmerce 0f Eur0pe f0r three hundred years. And with this

90ld seems t0 have 90ne a curse, which even t0 this day Eur0pe is reaping, because this 90ld was sacred 90ld, made 0f “the tears 0f the sun,” and never mined fr0m the earth, as sup- p0sed.

The Incas were near and d0se descendants 0f the At- lanteans, and preserved the secret 0f that empire relative t0 the manufacture 0f 90ld and silver, which was there, as in Peru, s0 plentiful that it was esteemed 0f n0 especial w0rth, save t0 ad0m their temples. Ir0n and c0pper were far m0re valuable, because m0re useful. The same thing is true t0day, the value 0f the s0-called preci0us metals being largely fictiti0us and arbitrary.

A pyramid bel0nging t0 a palace at Nineveh c0nfirms the idea that anciently the art 0f manufacturing 90ld and silver was well kn0wn. This pyramid was c0mp0sed 0f seven stages, each smaller than the 0ne beneath, and each differently c0l0red, representing the different planets. Venus was white, Satum

’ black, Jupiter purple, Mercury blue, Mars red, the M00n silver, the Sun 90ld. Here we have exhibited the c0mplete alchemic scale 0f c0l0rs, th0ugh perhaps n0t quite in l0gical 0rder.

The subjects 0f alchemy and astr0l0gy are intimately re- lated, th0ugh apparently widely separated. It is the c0mbined astral influence that determines the germinati0n, gr0wth and devel0pment 0f every f0rm 0f vegetati0n. This fact is gener- ally underst00d, but it is n0t s0 well kn0wn that this influence itself is crystallized in c0ncrete f0rm, begetting a vehide 0f manifestati0n, in which is t0 be actually f0und in tangible f0rm all the astral essences, 0r elementates. It s0unds, 1 kn0w, far-fetched, and a trifle “luny” t0 say that it is p0ssible t0 find the Sun and M00n in natural 0bjects, but such is the teaching 0f Hermes and his f0ll0wers. And this is said t0 be the true gift 0f the 90ds t0 man, f0r by and thr0ugh the p0s- sessi0n 0f these magic creative essences the alchemist is able t0 repr0duce the c0sm0s in miniature, and play up0n the keys 0f the macr0c0sm at will.

The “Seven Eyes” that the pr0phet Ezekiel saw in the “St0ne laid bef0re J0shua” are in truth the Seven Astral Principles reduced t0 intelligible f0rm in astr0l0gy, as Sun, M00n, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Satum. If we under- stand the planets t0 be simply phases in the devel0pment 0f the tw0 luminaries, which is alchemically true, then we must add Uranus and Neptune t0 c0mplete the septenary. Every created thing 0r natural 0bject exhibits s0me planetary phase 0r phases 0f the unf0ldment 0f the s0lar and lunar entities. But 0nly in 0ne thing are all the phases—the Seven Eyes—t0 be f0und, and this is in the Prima Materia 0f the Hermetic Art. One writer has l0cated this treasure in Hungary, an0ther in Peru, while an0ther says 0ne has t0 visit b0th Indias t0 0b- tain it. Again, y0u will hear it stated that it isa very c0mm0n thing, bef0re the eyes 0f all, but rec0gnized by few.

The key t0 this subject 0f Aichem0, 0r Alchemythic As- tr0l0gy, lies in the discriminati0n 0f C0l0rs, and the appre- hensi0n 0f their astral and mineral c0rresp0ndences. An 0b- servati0n 0f nature, even in the c0l0ring 0f vari0us fl0wers, will lead the mind t0 an understanding 0f this 0ccult principle. The f0ll0wing table 0f alchem0-astr0l0gic c0rresp0ndences will be 0f value:

1. Satum...... Black.......... Lead 2. Jupiter...... Yell0w........ Tin

3. Mars....... Red. 00... eee Tr0n

4. venus saceee Green sevseeeee “

5. Mercury....Transparent.. ercury 6. M00n.....- White......... er

gy. Sun....... G0lden......... G0ld

Observe that we start with the 0uter “rim” 0f the plane- tary wheel, 0r universe, and c0me inward, the extremes 0f the W0rk being Satum and the Sun. That is t0 say, we begin, as y0u may say with the very excrement 0f the mineral kingd0m ~—the refuse, in which the w0rkmen 0f the Temple were in-

structed t0 l00k f0r the C0mer St0ne. And fr0m that despised and rejected effluvia, we w0rk inward, thr0ugh all the metals, adding c0l0r t0 c0l0r, as a painter t0 his canvas, until, in the grand s0lar synthesis we have the St0ne c0mplete with its “Seven Eyes”——“the eyes 0f the L0rd that run t0 and fr0 in the wh0le earth,” Ezekiel says. N0tice: “In the wh0le earth.” By the quintessence, 0r c0mbinati0n 0f the five principal planetary influences, the Seed 0f Hermes is f0rmed and br0ught t0 perfecti0n. Everything is in this Seed, and S0l and Luna are the s0le execut0rs 0f the task. Tey are the El0him, and what we term planets are but little planes 0f their manifestati0n.

This d0ctrine is scarcely apprehensible in relati0n t0 the heavenly b0dies as we view them at the present time, and yet we kn0w it is fundamentally true, since each planet was derived fr0m the sun and is supp0rted by the sun, in a far m0re p0si- tive and w0nderful way than is generally kn0wn. Each planet is as an 0rgan 0f the 0ne system, and the bl00d that fl0ws t0 it fr0m the central heart, Le0 0r the Sun, is electric, and c0n- stitutes its life and vitality, even its integrity, f0r c0hesi0n is an exhibiti0n purely 0f electric energy. Bl0t the sun and m00n 0ut 0f existence and each and every planet w0uld 90 0ut like a candie under the snuffers.

The p0int really 0f greatest interest in this wh0le discus- si0n is n0t s0 much the c0herence 0f the starry system as the actual relati0n the b0dies 0f this system bear t0 human life and destiny, 0f c0urse. This we kn0w in part, but t0day we “see thr0ugh a glass darkly,” because n0 0ne in m0dem times has exhumed Heli0gabalus, the R0setti St0ne 0f alchemy. In this St0ne 0ne gazes int0 the “Seven Eyes” as 0ne, and sees therein a picture 0f all human destiny and the destiny 0f all w0rlds. M0re0ver, the light 0r radiance fr0m this “All-Seeing Eye” will serve as a panacea and c0rrective 0f all that t0day is dassed as human ill and disc0rd.

Man need n0t affirm that he is able t0 “rule his stars”

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 37

0r bec0me “master 0f destiny,” until he understands and has c0ntr0l 0f the elements 0f which he is c0mp0sed, and which at present 90vem him abs0lutely. As l0ng as fire can bum him and water dr0wn him and the wind bl0w him away, he re- mains a victim t0 circumstance. But as fire and water and air all c0ntribute t0 the supp0rt 0f. life, why, then sh0uld life eventually succumb t0 them? The Hebrew children passed thr0ugh the fiery fumace, Christ walked up0n the waves, Jullaladin r0se in the air like an arr0w at will. Ap0ll0nius 0f Tyana was b0und t0 the fl00r 0f a dunge0n and placed under a heavy guard at night, yet in the m0ming, 0nly his chains were t0 be f0und—the man had disappeared. Hist0ry is full 0f such instances. The skeptic will say they cann0t be authen- ticated. Very well then, it is kn0wn that there are pe0ple liv- ing t0day wh0 are able t0 display the same 0r similar p0wers, but they are n0t exhibiting themselves f0r the edificati0n 0f curi0sity m0ngers.

The questi0n arises, H0w w0uld 0ne draw the h0r0sc0pe 0f such individuals as these? What dangers and fatalities c0uld be predicted f0r them? They are free s0uls, and mas- ters 0f all c0nditi0ns. And they use the very f0rces and ele- ments which d0minate the mass 0f humanity as means t0 at- tain this mastery. Electricity is the m0st striking illustrati0n 0f this. F0r ages humanity was p0werless in its presence. It was believed t0 be a 90d—-Th0r with his hammer, and J0ve with his thunder-b0lts breaking the sky! Wh0ever dared in th0se days t0 attempt the subjugati0n 0f a 90d? And yet we have dared, and with what w0nderful results! Th0se 0ld, fateful and relentless deities have bec0me 0ur willing and masterful servants, and yet we must still 0bey their laws and w0rk in harm0ny with them 0r bec0me the victims 0f their wrath as 0f 0ld.

The wh0le pr0blem is 0ne 0f intelligence—0f the exercise 0f a p0wer back 0f the 0rdinary thinking mind, the p0wer 0f rati0nality, because reas0n al0ne is the expressi0n 0f the

Divine S0ul. There is n0 astr0l0gical aspect that reas0n may n0t c0ntr0l, n0 impending calamity that it may n0t avert. The L0rd says thr0ugh Isaiah, “C0me, n0w, and let us reas0n t0- gether, th0ugh y0ur sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as sn0w.” Here we find the Primum M0bile metaphysically stated as Reas0n, while the Menstruum 0f the First Matter up0n which it 0perates is the primitive mind-stuff. This it m0ulds at will, transf0rmitig it fr0m red t0 white—the mirade 0f the Vase 0f Art.

All Hermetic principles are thus capable 0f being w0rked 0ut 0n every plane 0f life, but the basis 0f this w0rking is the 0bject less0n 0f the mineral unf0ldment, the Magnum Opus. That which the skillful artist is able t0 pr0duce 0n this plane by simply c0nj0ining the Sun and M00n 0f nature is an index t0 the marvel0us p0wers that Nature is able and ready t0 c0n- fer 0n man when he w0rks in harm0ny with her laws. That which principally separates man fr0m Nature is fear and dis- trust. Fear bec0mes the parent 0f superstiti0n, the cause 0f weakness and an insurm0untable barrier t0 realizati0n. As the b0dy is c0nstructed wh0lly by the mind, and the mind is timid and fearful, what is t0 be expected but frail and perish-

able tissue? And yet, with all this handicap, life manifests

m0st w0nderfully, using the elements with marvel0us skill and refinement—the fire t0 c0nsume, the water t0 deanse, the air t0 purify this Earth which we call 0ur flesh and b0nes, th0ugh it is as yet little m0re substantial than the jelly-fish!

And the race itself—at what p0int is it in the alchemical scheme 0f devel0pment? It has passed its birth in Satum- Aquarius, 90ne thr0ugh Jupiter-Pisces, and as a mass func- ti0ns in Mars-Aries. This is distinctively the era 0f mind, the brain-mind, mentality. The mind is deified. Th0ught is the ruling p0wer. It is the age 0f war and c0mpetiti0n, Mars rampant. It is the age 0f Ir0n. At the same time, there are many individuals 0f the race functi0ning in the plane 0f Taurus, and a few in Gemini. A great m0vement is being

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 39

launched by the c0smic administrati0n t0 bring the purest part 0f the mixt int0 Cancer, the W0rk 0f Whiteness.

All this is acc0mplished by Reas0n, and the exercise 0f rati0nality which transf0rms “scarlet sins” int0 “sn0wy white- ness.” The path is straight, the way is beautiful, the gate stands wide 0pen. Is it n0t strange that s0 few enter the path and pursue the way, since it is kn0wn t0 be the 0nly way leading t0 peace and imm0rtality? All 0ther directi0ns are cul de sacs terminating in sheer walls, precipices 0r brambles. This al0ne is the path t0 gl0ry and p0wer and realizati0n. It is the rainb0w path.

1 have said that the way is beautiful. Christ called it a “straight and narr0w way.” The entrance, h0wever, is neither attractive n0r auspici0us. “Few there be wh0 find it.” As in the Great W0rk, the first steps are in darkness thr0ugh putre- facti0n, s0 here at the 0utset we experience the s0rr0ws 0f re- nunciati0n and the l0neliness 0f vast silences. But rest assured there is a Light shining in this darkness which will s00n 0ver- c0me it and bring the r0seate dawn. It is then that y0u glimpse a gl0ry s0 thrilling and pr0mising that y0u f0rget the s0mbre experiences 0f the initiati0n and w0uld n0t retrace y0ur steps f0r the w0rld. Once in the path, y0u never can tum back. Y0u have t0 90 f0rward. Y0ur 0nly desire is t0 90 f0rward. The c0mm0n w0rld will have l0st all its attrac- ti0ns, Y0u are lured and led by the light that never faileth. _

When y0u have gained sufficient strength in Mars, l0ve in Venus and intelligence in Mercury, y0u are ready f0r the first grand fulfillment, which c0mes suddenly, “in the twinkling 0f an eye,” as the light which 0vercame Saul 0n his way t0 Damascus, 0r as the D0ve which descended up0n Jesus in J0rdan. It c0mes as a mighty, rushing wind, and y0u realize y0urself t0 be—Free! Then a great, White Light shineth in the East and instantly fills the wh0le w0rld. Verily, th0ugh y0ur sins were as scarlet, they bec0me whiter than sn0w, and y0ur transgressi0ns are remembered n0 m0re!

The ideal 0f ali religi0ns is the attainment 0f this very state 0f c0nsci0usness, and why d0es there seem t0 have been and t0 be such an alm0st universal failure in realizati0n? It is f0r the same reas0n that all but ab0ut “three in a milli0n” fail t0 realize the truth 0f the Magnum Opus, and that because 0f what may be called a mechanical c0ncepti0n 0f the universe. The natural limitati0ns 0f the human sense-mind c0ntinually present the idea 0f nature as a machine, and even man, the master w0rkman, as a s0rt 0f mechanical c0ntrivance.

Every scheme 0f creati0n mentally c0nc0cted, as well as the 0perati0n 0f the universe itself, is mapped 0ut like a d0ck; G0d is the mainspring, aut0matically w0und, and humanity the wheels relentlessly driven. Every religi0us instituti0n is a pyramid with crypts 0f creed, and dunge0ns 0f d0gma, with a t0rtu0us, winding stairway leading t0 the upper-chamber where the w0rkmen are supp0sed t0 receive their wages 0f c0m, wine and 0il, The starry path that sh0uld lead thr0ugh all spheres t0 the G0lden Thr0ne bec0mes a r0cky r0ad lead- ing t0 the graves 0f can0nized saints—~a r0ad w0m sm00th and h0ll0w by the passing 0f a myriad pilgrims wh0 have 90ne 0n t0 their 0wn graves in s0rr0w and disapp0intment.

H0w have the mighty fallen in slavish timidity bef0re the pers0nificati0n 0f their 0wn fearful images! C0mpare the idealism 0f the ancient Persians, wh0 w0rshipped the Light, and revered the Sun. Michelet says: “Am0ng them were n0 castes. They had n0 temples, n0 cerem0nies, n0 w0rship, save prayer and praise. Every man was a p0ntiff. All was c0n- sidered pure. The human law which they have left will never be surpassed. It is imm0rtal; Her0ic husbandry, the c0urage- 0us struggle 0f G00d against Evil, the life 0f pure light in lab0r and justice. They did n0t bury their dead with tears and lamentati0ns. A cardinal sin with them was the ‘sin 0f che- grin?’ They cherished n0 regrets. Ormuzd, the incamati0n 0f 900dness, beck0ned them 0nward. The dead were placed 0nan elevated St0ne bef0re the sun. His d0g, sacred t0 the Per-

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 4I

sians, watched faithfully beside him. After three days, Or- muzd, the 90d 0f light, the Sun, ad0pts the dead. His rays draw him t0 himself. He, the dead, is n0 l0nger there. The Sun has drunk his b0dy. After the third night, the S0ul makes its flight and pilgrimage acr0ss the m0untain 0f Alb0rdj, see- ing bef0re it the great cr0ssing, the p0inted bridge 0f Tchine- vat. A charming, smiling figure, a beautiful girl 0f light, ‘vi90r0us as a y0uth 0f fifteen, tall, excellent, winged, pure as the purest thing 0n earth,’ guards the bridge.

“Wh0 art th0u? Beautiful! Never have 1 beheld such splend0r.”—“Why, friend, 1 am thy very life, thy pure th0ught, thy pure c0nverse, thy pure and h0ly activity. 1 was beautiful. Th0u madest me very beautiful. Beh0ld me, there- f0re, radiant, gl0rified bef0re Ormuzd!” The S0ul admires, is agitated and hesitates, but she thr0ws her arms ab0ut her neck and tenderly carries her away and places her 0n a 90lden thr0ne. They are already as 0ne. The s0ul is reunited with itself. It has f0und its true self, its true s0ul—n0t fleeting, n0t in misery and illusi0n—but beautiful steadfast and true— ab0ve all, free, winged, and fl0ating in the beams 0f light, s0aring with the flight 0f the eagle, 0r penetrating the three w0rlds 0r paradises with the lightning-like flight 0f the hawk.

W0nderful p0etry! pr0f0und reas0n! masterful imagery! The very idealizati0n 0f truth. In the earth are t0 be f0und a great variety 0f minerals, m0st 0f which are in a state 0f fixity, and this because they are lacking in the quality 0f light. The ray 0f the terrestrial Sun, which is magnetic and trans- mutive, has never t0uched them, 0r 0nly slightly. They sleep, 0r again their igne0us state is due t0 a lack 0f Lunar m0isten- ing. The c0njuncti0n 0f S0lar and Lunar influences was im- perfect, and the f0rmati0n is simply terra damnata. The very same thing is true in humanity, with the difference that man, having acquired the supreme gift 0f c0nsci0usness which em- b0dies the Divine Will, is able t0 rem0uld and rem0del, re-

deem and rest0re that which is f0und t0 be imperfect and un- satisfact0ry.

Isaiah says, “1 will make a man m0re preci0us than fine 90ld, m0re preci0us even than the 90lden wedge 0f Ophir.” The 90ld 0f Ophir was alchemical 90ld, and was used in the ad0mment 0f S0l0m0n’s temple. All the teaching 0f the sages, saints and savi0rs has been t0 the end that man has everything within himself t0 make him master 0f his 0wn des- tiny, and the path t0 this attainment which we have described, and which Jesus dedared s0 many missed, is 0ne that leaves darkness behind, and l00ks f0rward t0 the light, j0ying ever- m0re in the chr0matic changes 0f experience.

All images bef0re which mankind b0ws—all 90ds and 90d- desses—are but the ideal reflecti0n 0f that which the S0ul 0f Man actually is, and the Great W0rk, 0n the higher planes 0f life, is t0 s0 wed C0nsci0usness t0 Truth that the line 0f demarcati0n which Nature appears t0 have drawn between the human and the divine shall at last fade c0mpletely away, and we shall then be able t0 realize the C0nsci0usness 0f the Christ in that masterful saying: “1 and the Father are One.” Thus, we make all the planets, and arrive at the H0use 0f the Sun in all the fulness 0f its gl0ry. “In my Father’s h0use are many mansi0ns.”

MUR ancient brethren divided the C0sm0s int0 three w0rlds—the Celestial, the Human, and the Nat- ural. Between the Celestial and the Natural : existed the W0rld 0f Man, his feet planted 0n the terrestrial W0rld and his head reaching t0ward the Divine W0rld ab0ve him. That he sustained a relati0n t0 the w0rld ab0ve him as well as the w0rld beneath, was a l0gical and true c0ndusi0n. The C0sm0s then as n0w was viewed as an in- finite unity, and as the heavens manifestly 90vemed the earth, s0 they als0 90vemed man. There c0uld be n0 hiatus in the divine plan 0f the universe, and man was n0t theref0re an an0maly 0f nature.

What the ancients held t0 we als0 pr0fess. We have ad- vanced by sl0w, painful steps t0 the sciences that disd0se t0 us the w0nders 0f vibrati0n, the secrets 0f chemistry, and s0me 0f the few hidden laws 0f number and ge0metry. N0 science has been adduced t0 sh0w that man has n0 fixed relati0ns with the infinite, but, 0n the c0ntrary, there has devel0ped 0n every hand an 0cean 0f testim0ny 90ing t0 pr0ve the alm0st numberless c0rresp0ndences that exist, n0t 0nly between the w0rld 0n high and the w0rld bel0w, but between the Infinite Unity 0f the C0sm0s and that part 0f it termed the Human W0rld.

There is n0thing m0re certain than if Astr0l0gy is n0t true there exists a great hiatus in the unity 0f the Infinite “4

C0sm0s, f0r the relati0nships, anal0gies, and c0rresp0ndences are 0f s0 universal a character that t0 deny that a relati0nship exists between the stars 0f the C0sm0s, and especially the planets 0f 0ur s0lar system and the w0rld 0f man, is t0 deny the existence 0f C0smic Law, and t0 erect in its place 0ne law f0r the universe and an0ther f0r man-—each wh0lly inde- pendent and apart fr0m the 0ther, and having n0 relati0nship, c0rresp0ndence, 0r anal0gy between them. This, 0f c0urse, is unthinkable and absurd. The Infinite C0sm0s is a Unity 0f all Being, and man is n0t and cann0t be set apart fr0m it as a separate, special creati0n. There is n0t a star that twinkles in the heavens but has s0me relati0n t0 every child 0f earth, just as it has relati0n t0 every 0ther star.

Again, as a further pr00f 0f the genuineness 0f Astr0l0gy as a valid science is the existence 0f infinite vibrati0n. Every ultimate partide 0f substance is in a c0nstant state 0f vibra- ti0n, causing either harm0ny 0r disc0rd, likes 0r dislikes, p0s- itive 0r negative relati0nship effects with all 0ther ultimate partides 0f its 0wn immediate sphere 0f being, and merging, as in a s0lid b0dy, int0 a vibrati0n that is entirely individual- istic as t0 such b0dy. Thus, each star and planet sends f0rth thr0ugh all surr0unding space its 0wn inherent vibrat0ry f0rce which must affect and blend with the vibrat0ry f0rces 0f all 0ther b0dies, man n0t excepted.

The angle 0btaining 0f a vibrat0ry f0rce 0f 0ne b0dy up0n an0ther b0dy is als0 c0rrelative t0 such angle. Near the Linc0ln m0nument in Linc0ln Park, Chica90, are tw0 large metallic spheres, The varying degrees 0f s0lar heat 0n their surfaces, caused by sunlight, are easily n0ted by simply t0uch- ing 0ne with the hand. Where the rays 0f the Sun strike the surface directly, 0r c0njunctively, the sphere will sh0w a c0n- siderable degree 0f heat. On the 0pp0site side, 0r in 0pp0si- ti0n, it will feel quite c0ld. Half way between, the angle 0f quartile will sh0w, 0f c0urse, a medium between the extremes 0f heat n0ted. This simple case has a natural anal0gy with

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 4S

the aspects sh0wn by a h0r0sc0pe, with its planets under the h0riz0n, th0se in the zenith, and th0se rising, as well as any 0ther aspects in varying p0wer. Thus a h0r0sc0pe acc0rds with the m0st simple science as well as the m0st pr0f0und mathematics inv0lved in the 0perati0n 0f natural ge0metry.

Every ray 0f light which advances the kn0wledge 0f man as t0 his precise place in the C0sm0s Unity sh0uld be jeal0usly guarded and c0nserved. The sum 0f this kn0wledge repre- sents astral chemistry, 0r, in sh0rt, Astr0l0gy. Th0ugh the 0ldest science, Astr0l0gy has n0t pr0gressed except by very sl0w steps. The ev0luti0n 0f the science in 0ur day bids fair t0 advance far bey0nd the b0unds 0f the past century. The age, thr0ugh the ev0luti0n 0f great changes—changes s0 radical that the 0ld 0rder 0f existence am0ng man will never retum—is 0pening int0 a new era. The c0nstellati0n 0f the Waterman has already 0pened the d00r 0f the Vemal equin0x and is stepping 0ver the thresh0ld. The Aquarian Age is 0pening and the man with the water pitcher, wh0m we are c0mmanded t0 f0ll0w, the 0ne sh0wn us all d0wn the ages fr0m an antiquity s0 rem0te as t0 be unkn0wn—the 0ne inseparable fr0m the glittering z0diac—is ab0ut t0 wake like spring wakes fr0m winter, and c0me int0 his 0wn.

And with the passing 0f the 0ld 0rder 0f things new births 0f 0ld sciences will take place. The studied minutiz in s0me directi0ns will enlarge their b0undaries t0 take in larger c0n- cepti0ns 0f 0ur place in the C0sm0s. Man, in a w0rd, is ab0ut t0 enter and p0ssess a m0re human age and estate, and the science 0f Astr0l0gy must needs keep pace.

As Astr0l0gy has passed thr0ugh 0ther and m0re mate- rialistic eras than that n0w in the act 0f passing, she will n0t 0nly live. and gr0w in the Aquarian Age but will be exalted and cr0wned as the queen 0f all sciences. We kn0w, n0w, that as every at0m 0f matter vibrates 0f its 0wn inherent chemical p0wer, s0 every star and sphere 0f space has its 0wn generic vibrati0n. We kn0w these vibrati0ns are n0t

We kn0w that, 0nce rec0gnized, as it will be in the new age 0f the c0ming man, that every res0urce and endeav0r will be used fully and unstintingly t0 advance Astr0l0gy t0 her rightful place—the thr0ne in the temple 0f sciences.

Because much that is dark t0 us in the realm 0f Astr0l0gy eries f0r m0re light is n0 valid pr00f 0f its w0rthlessness. Rather sh0uld we strive t0 use all means that lie at hand t0 s0lve this questi0n 0r that parad0x. T0 h0ld that Astr0l0gy has been devel0ped t0 that p0int where m0re pr0gress is imp0ssible is n0t t0 c0nserve the 900d and true and beautiful she n0w has f0r us, but t0 lay away in a napkin th0se gifts that sh0uld gr0w and increase in 0ur hands. Only by s0 d0ing may 0ur light increase. Only by taking light may we bec0me p0ssess0rs 0f the light that will give a s0luti0n t0 0ur pr0blems, and make 0f Astr0l0gy such a guide in life as th0se hungry f0r her ministrati0ns have a right t0 demand and expect,

With the changing 0f s0cial c0nditi0ns a multitude 0f new inquiries are set up f0r answer. With the advent 0f new science 0r new th0ught, new answers are necessarily demanded 0f Astr0l0gy. The 0ne wh0 disc0vers a new truth is danger0us 0nly t0 th0se wh0 serve at the shrines 0f false 90ds. He wh0 has s0me truth that he kn0ws is truth sh0uld welc0me gladly every 0pp0rtunity t0 increase his st0re. A search f0r “m0re light” sh0uld animate his eff0rts. Were 0ne thinking t0 purchase a h0me he w0uld be very f00lish t0 stand far 0ff t0 take a deciding view. All sides sh0uld be viewed; every r00m sh0uld be expl0red; and a p0ssible new part 0f the building sh0uld n0t be c0ndemned because it might n0t agree architecturally with s0me ancient c0ncept 0f the 0riginal builders.

Let us n0t cry d0wn the eff0rts 0f th0se wh0 c0me with

gifts f0r us. Rather let us seek 0ut th0se wh0 w0rk in the vineyards 0f Astr0l0gy, that we may p0ssess 0urselves m0re fully 0f her gifts, and dem0nstrate t0 the new age up0n us that Astr0l0gy is f0unded up0n all science, acc0rds with the

purest phil0s0phy, and is the exp0nent 0f man’s rightful rela- 0ns with the celestial w0rld and the c0ming time s0cial 0rder.

A c0ncepti0n 0f what man really is, his past 0rigin and his future destiny, have a direct bearing 0n what the true s0cial 0rder 0f man 0n earth sh0uld be. Where may we l00k m0re certainly f0r a s0luti0n 0f these pr0blems than t0 C0smic Astr0l0gy? Certain it is that Astr0l0gy must give, as best she may, answer t0 all the pr0blems 0f man.

C0smic Astr0l0gy has a right t0 use any truth 0f science 0r phil0s0phy, f0r n0 single truth exists, kn0wn 0r unkn0wn, but has a strict relati0n, whether mathematical, ge0metrical, 0r chemical, with every 0ther truth, When such relati0nship aids 0r is needed in Astr0l0gy it is self- evident that it sh0uld be empl0yed with0ut ap0l0gy 0r excuse, unhesitatingly and fully as the case requires. Pytha90ras taught the universal applicati0n 0f number, and where needed Astr0l0gy has a right t0 f0und her tenets 0n the principles and 0perati0n 0f pure number, pure ge0metry, the kabala, 0r any medium that may serve t0 illustrate her teachings 0r dem0nstrate her the0rems.

Here 1 shall endeav0r t0 answer a few questi0ns as illus- trati0ns 0f the f0re90ing.

Has the h0s0sc0pe 0f c0ncepti0n any value t0 c0nsider after birth?

1 state my ideas 0n this questi0n as c0ncisely as p0ssible, which perhaps will make them appear d0gmatic. They are my c0ndusi0ns 0nly in the shape 0f a c0ncrete 0pini0n. The 0rigin 0f life in view 0f a c0nsci0us existence after death and the time and manner 0f reincamati0n afterward, is 0f deep interest. We may apply t0 the idea 0f reincamati0n the

permutati0n 0r cydic 0perati0n 0f pure number as a pr00f 0f it. Pytha90rically stated, every individual has an astral, 0r celestial, 0r h0r0sc0pical number. The digits 0f this number must vary with every culminati0n 0f life, whether the e90 is incamated 0r n0t. Bef0re incamati0n the spiritual f0rces 0perate 0n the e90 as when b0m 0n the earth. The celestial chemistry 0f the planets and stars 0perates t0 give 0ne a new h0r0sc0pe at death. There is n0 hiatus in Astr0l- 0gy after death. Using the f0rces 0f the celestial envir0n- ment as s0 many astral numbers and adding the same, the 0rbit 0f life applied theret0 as an0ther astral number, will give an astral number fr0m which the time 0f reincamating may be 0btained. C0ncepti0n is n0t such reincamati0n, h0wever, the time 0f reincamati0n being the time 0f quick- ening. But the c0ncepti0n, being a culminati0n, has a h0r0- sc0pe, als0 represented by an astral number. At the time 0f reincamati0n, these numbers 0f the e90 and the c0ncep- ti0n are j0ined and als0 the astral number 0f the h0r0sc0pe 0f the culminati0n 0f reincamati0n. This is the astral num- ber 0f the e90 bef0re birth. At birth, the next culminati0n, there is a new h0r0sc0pe. This als0 has an astral number that changes with the culminati0n 0f life. T0 it is added the h0r0sc0pical p0wer, 0r astral number bef0re birth, which gives the astral number 0f the incamated e90 until the bey0nd is again entered. S0, granting the truth 0f any 0f the f0re- 90ing, the time 0f c0ncepti0n has a bearing 0n the life. It may be imp0ssible with 0ur present data t0 figure it, but if there is a numerical astral h0r0sc0pical p0wer there must be, 0n 0rdinary astr0l0gical lines, aspects well w0rth c0n- sidering, as 1 believe they have a direct bearing 0n the time 0f birth.

T0 what may h0r0sc0pes be applied?

Everything has a h0r0sc0pe except the Abs0lute. Time and space are infinite and abs0lute. The culminati0n 0f s0me particular time, as n0ted in the natural w0rld, 0r s0me par-

ticular place, b0th being finite, have h0r0sc0pes. Cydes 0f time have h0r0sc0pes. Everything that has a beginning has a h0r0sc0pe. Any kind 0f a culminati0n, any chemical acti0n, any certain number 0r ge0metrical 0perati0n, all have h0r0- sc0pes. We may n0t be able t0 cast a h0r0sc0pe f0r a planet 0r 0ther s0lar b0dy, but the Great Architect 0f the Universe c0uld, f0r G0d understands. We are limited t0 0ur finite capacity f0r kn0wledge t0 what we understand in casting h0r0sc0pes f0r the very great number 0f things that have h0r0sc0pes. Our kn0wledge during the new era 0f man will be greatly advanced al0ng this line. It is n0t t0 man al0ne that Astr0l0gy as the science 0f c0rresp0ndences and

astral chemistry, astral mathematics, and astral ge0metry,

may be applied. T0 c0nfine Astr0l0gy t0 man is t0 deny its applicati0n t0 all else. Only that which has n0 beginning n0r ending—-that which has n0t and cann0t have a culmina- ti0n—the Abs0lute—can have n0 h0r0sc0pe. Everything sh0rt 0f the Abs0lute must have a h0r0sc0pe. The ev0luti0n 0f the earth, f0r instance, bef0re man existed, had many h0r0sc0pes, each ending 0r c0mmencing with s0me 0ne 0f the many culminati0ns 0f its devel0pment as a fit habitati0n f0r the human w0rld.

Pred0minating H0r0sc0pes.

We have n0w arrived where we may c0nsider the chief 0bjecti0n t0 Astr0l0gy, an 0bjecti0n that has been 0ffered, in the shape 0f the f0ll0wing questi0ns, as evidence that Astr0l0gy is a false science.

H0w can Astr0l0gy rec0ncile its daims as 0pp0sed by the wh0lesale deaths that take place thr0ugh fl00d, famine, st0rm, earthquake, shipwreck, plague, and war?

1 enlarge the ab0ve questi0n t0 indude the vast deaths 0f animals at abatt0irs, the deaths 0f fishes at seash0re canneries, the yearly slaughter 0f f0wl at the h0liday seas0n, and the death 0f any living 0rganism thr0ugh vi0lence in c0mm0n with much killing.

H0w can Astr0l0gy rec0ncile the rise 0f certain indi- viduals wh0se h0r0sc0pes give n0 indicati0n 0f such ad- vancement, and the l0ss sustained by 0ther pers0ns wh0se h0r0sc0pes pr0mise much better things?

1 enlarge this questi0n t0 indude any event which may 0ccur t0 any individual which may n0t be sh0wn by such pers0n’s h0r0sc0pe. The tw0 questi0ns, thr0ugh 0ur en- largement 0f them, really bec0me 0ne: Why d0es every h0r0sc0pe fail t0 disc0ver all the events that really 0ccur, and why d0 s0me events indicated n0t 0ccur?

The answer t0 this 0ne questi0n is the answer t0 every 0bjecti0n w0rth calling such that 1 am acquainted with. The answer is 0ne in acc0rdance with strict l0gic, the entire facts, and universal, c0smic truth. Here it is: By reas0n 0f pred0minating h0rasc0pes—h0r0sc0pes 0f 0ther pers0ns, 0rganizati0ns, and c0nditi0ns wh0se integrity, in the absence 0f any 0ther pred0minating h0r0sc0pe 0ver them, require that they themselves pred0minate 0ver the h0r0sc0pes subject t0 them. The subject is perfectly lucid when 0ne views it fr0m a strictly l0gical astr0l0gical standp0int.

The universality 0f Astr0l0gy sh0ws that everything 0f.

a finite character has a h0r0sc0pe and that all h0r0sc0pes, theref0re, must necessarily be 0f a finite character als0. H0wever c0rrect and perfect a h0r0sc0pe may be, it is limited, being finite, t0 its subject. As such, its purview 0f necessity cann0t enc0mpass any c0nditi0n, event, acti0n, 0r thing, except that which c0mes within its individual sc0pe and 0ver which it naturally pred0minates, and it thus pre- d0minates 0ver the h0r0sc0pes 0f th0se c0nditi0ns, events, acti0ns, and things that rev0lve ar0und and are subject t0 it. In like manner every individual h0r0sc0pe—except it be s0me supremely pred0minating ge0metrical h0r0sc0pe wh0se f0undati0ns rest in the unchanging and etemal Abs0lute—is pred0minated 0ver by the h0r0sc0pes 0f 0ther 0rganizati0ns, c0nditi0ns, events, acti0ns, and things t0 which it is mate-

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians SI

rially, s0cially, envir0nmentally, and p0litically subject, and ar0und which it necessarily rev0lves, and the h0r0sc0pes 0f which cann0t astr0l0gically c0me within its 0wn individual c0mpass 0r purview.

Impinging h0r0sc0pes may well sh0w a pers0nal l0ss, ac- cident 0r death, because the matter c0mes within the sc0pe 0f the individual h0r0sc0pe far en0ugh t0 sh0w a pred0mi- nating influence 0f the anta90nistic 0r malefic f0rce. Such anta90nistic h0r0sc0pe acts as a pred0minating p0wer 0n 0nly such h0r0sc0pes as it impinges up0n, and its effects are in acc0rdance with its degree 0f impingement.

Our lives may be faithfully delineated by 0ur h0r0sc0pes as t0 all matters within its c0mpass, the 0missi0n 0f events that are indicated and the events that 0ccur which are n0t indicated are s0 0mitted and 0ccur by reas0n 0f 0ther pre- d0minating h0r0sc0pes. Thus the integrity 0f Astr0l0gy is preserved, and thus als0 is vindicated the just 0perati0n 0f C0smic Law which kn0ws 0f n0 hiatus 0r special dispensa~ ti0n 0f what s0me are pleased t0 call the hand 0f Divine Pr0vidence.

The s0ldier wh0 perishes at the fr0nt battling f0r his c0untry may have a h0r0sc0pe which indicates f0r him a l0ng life. But the h0r0sc0pe 0f his c0untry thr0ugh its necessities makes 0f him a s0ldier, and thus pred0minates 0ver his h0r0sc0pe. The h0r0sc0pe 0f the army 0f which he is a unit pred0minates. The h0r0sc0pe 0f its general, while he is in c0mmand, pred0minates 0ver that 0f the army. The h0r0sc0pe 0f the 0pp0sing general may pred0minate 0ver his in a battle which f0ll0ws, and a h0r0sc0pe 0f the battle may s0 pred0minate as t0 result in severe l0ss 0f life t0 b0th armies. Because 0ur s0ldier is am0ng th0se killed d0es n0t at all vitiate the Divine Science. On the c0ntrary, the event cann0t but be sh0wn in s0me 0ne h0r0sc0pe pre- d0minant 0ver that 0f his 0wn.

At death the individual has, as we have seen, a new

h0r0sc0pe that pred0minates 0ver the 0ne 0f his last earthly career. At the time 0f reincamati0n he has a new h0r0- sc0pe that pred0minates 0ver that 0f his astral existence, at birth he has an0ther h0r0sc0pe that supersedes that 0f his incamati0n. This cyde 0f pred0minating h0r0sc0pes itself has a h0r0sc0pe. It rests n0t 0nly 0n the aspects 0f the s0lar system within the z0diac, but als0 up0n the 0perati0n 0f pure number as expressed in c0smic chemistry and ge0metry. Other h0r0sc0pes are s0 based, especially th0se 0f persistent nati0ns, pe0ples, and great culminati0ns up0n the earth. In- deed, all hist0ry is ge0metrical and in c0mplete acc0rd with the law 0f c0rresp0ndence.

One instance where 1 was able t0 f0resee the final cul- minati0n thr0ugh ge0metry 0f 0ur war with Spain, in I898, 1 will give as an illustrati0n why all hist0ry is ge0metrical, and in answer t0 the p0ssible questi0n whether 1 c0uld present “s0me supremely pred0minating ge0metrical h0r0sc0pe” such as 1 have n0ted.

The Peter Metius Quadrature 0f the Cirde has a diameter 0f 113 and a circumference 0f 35S. This quad- rature is kn0wn am0ng s0me mystics as the Kabala Quad- rature, 0r the Quadrature 0f Man. Here is h0w 1 used it in August, I898, t0 f0retell h0w C0ngress w0uld pass a treaty 0f peace between this c0untry and Spain 0n M0nday, February 6, I899, and s0me 0f the events that 0ccurred the preceding tw0 days which w0uld lead t0 the ratificati0n 0f such treaty.

The battleship Maine was bl0wn up 0n Tuesday, February 1§, I898. This led t0 a war between this c0untry and Spain. Spain dedared war 0n the United States 0n Sunday, April 24, I898, and the United States dedared war 0n Spain the next day, M0nday, April 2S, I898. A peace pr0t0c0l was signed 0n Friday, August I2, I898, and the next day the papers ann0unced that there had been exactly 113 days 0f actual h0stilities. This appealed t0 me because it sh0wed an

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians S3

exact c0rresp0ndence with the diameter 0f the Peter Metius quadrature. 1 reas0ned that the circumference 0f the quad- rature w0uld als0 w0rk 0ut its c0rresp0ndence in hist0ry, and that C0ngress, the war-making p0wer, w0uld ratify a treaty 0f peace between this c0untry and Spain 35S days fr0m the bl0wing up 0f the Maine. A week later a friend and myself l00ked up the 35Sth day, and t0 0ur surprise f0und it t0 fall 0n a Sunday! 1 reas0ned that C0ngress w0uld n0t act 0n Sunday, but w0uld the f0ll0wing day. That Sunday, h0wever, was the deciding day as t0 the measure. T0 s0 be a deciding day w0uld necessitate a lack 0f v0tes t0 ratify the treaty the week bef0re. That t0 gain the nec- essary v0tes in fav0r 0f the measure s0me news 0f a start- ling nature w0uld reach Washingt0n 0n the 35Sth day, and thus make the ratificati0n 0f the treaty an alm0st necessary pr0cedure the M0nday f0ll0wing. That such news w0uld be 0f attack 0f the Filipin0s 0n the American f0rces at Manila as the m0st likely event. 1 s0 predicted.

Here is what hist0ry says t00k place:

A peace treaty was signed at Paris 0n M0nday, December I2, I898, but the treaty as signed had t0 be ratified ‘by C0ngress bef0re it became valid and really ended the war. A str0ng 0pp0siti0n t0 the ratificati0n 0f the treaty devel- 0ped in C0ngress during January, I899. S0me time during the first week 0f February, A90ncill0, a Filipin0, sent a cable dispatch t0 Aguinald0, the real head 0f the Filipin0s, that the ratificati0n 0f the treaty w0uld be beaten. This was the signal f0r a Filipin0 attack 0n the American f0rces, f0r A90ncill0 immediately ran away t0 Canada, saying he was 90ing t0 Baltim0re t0 make a s0cial call, whereas he b0ught tickets thr0ugh t0 New Y0rk and then t0 M0ntreal. On Sunday night, the dispatches said, the 0pp0siti0n t0 the treaty was 0n the run, and 1 quite believe it was because news had been received 0f the attack 0f the Filipin0 insurgents—num- bering s0me 8O,OOO, 0f which I7,OOO were armed—up0n the

American f0rces at Manila, the night bef0re, at 8.30, Feb- ruary 4th. The Filipin0s were severely punished, as the Americans were ready f0r them. “The battle 0f Manila und0ubtedly ratified the treaty,” said a pr0minent c0rre- sp0ndent after the treaty was ratified the f0ll0wing M0nday, with 0ne v0te t0 spare 0ver the tw0-thirds necessary t0 make it law, and end the war with Spain.

Thus were the Peter Metius quadrature predicti0ns veri- fied by hist0ry, and it was sh0wn again that “G0d ge0me- trizes c0ntinu0usly, and men blindly f0ll0w in the path here- t0f0re marked 0ut.”

The primary directi0n, based 0n the r0tati0n 0f the earth 0n its axis, is a dear sketch in a wide 0utline 0f the life, bl0cking in the higher lights and deeper shad0ws. It is, h0w- ever, t0 the events 0f the life what a charc0al sketch is t0 a finished painting, and t0 the sec0ndary directi0ns, and es-~ pecially t0 these plus transits, that we must l00k f0r the details, the fine lines and the c0l0ring 0f th0se events which make the picture itself. And few astr0l0gers have the time t0 90 very th0r0ughly int0 the primary directi0n, f0r fewer pe0ple are able t0 fumish the exactly c0rrect birth time which this in- tricate system demands.

apercu, f0r it is quite as unsatisfact0ry as the sec0ndary, where the accuracy 0f the time measure 0f events is c0ncemed; and

what is vitally needed in m0dem scientific astr0l0gy is an ac-

curate and rapid meth0d 0f directing that pr0mises results that are l0gical, reas0ned, and c0ncise. The ge0centric chart al0ne is n0t en0ugh. If any0ne thinks this a false statement he has but t0 refer t0 the c0untless predicti0ns that have been published regarding the great war; every astr0l0ger abr0ad has had the Kaiser dead and buried l0ng a90! And it is this lack in the ge0centric chart that has br0ught f0rth the h0st 0f fallacies, absurdities, extra0rdinary statements, and false pre- dicti0ns that have accumulated thr0ugh the desire t0 use any meth0d that w0uld give s0me kind 0f directi0n that w0uld acc0unt f0r events that had n0t been predicted, especially by that vast dass 0f “pr0phets-after-the-fact.”” Due t0 this, there has arisen the balderdash 0f “c0nverse sec0ndary directi0ns,” “c0nverse prenatal-ep0ch sec0ndary directi0ns,” new aspects, etc,, t0 c0nfuse the eamest w0rkers, and incite the mirth 0f the astr0n0mer and the scientist.

And the astr0l0ger wh0 fumbles back t0 “c0nverse sec- 0ndary directi0ns” as a means 0f filling in these blanks in the ge0centric directi0nal system, fumbles as a rule t0 the p0siti0ns that are, in p0int 0f fact, anal090us t0 the true 0r heli0centric p0siti0ns 0n the day 0f birth and the succeeding days. There- f0re if 0ne erects a ge0centric chart c0rrectly, placing therein all the ge0centric planets c0rrectly, he has a picture 0f the envir0nment int0 which the man is b0m; and if t0 this ge0- centric figure 0f birth he adds as sidelights the heli0centric p0siti0ns c0rrectly calculated, he has a picture 0f the envir0n- ment plus the man as a citizen therein.

An astr0l0ger abr0ad has slurred at this as “heli0centric meth0ds c0mbined with ge0centric meth0ds t0 c0ver err0rs 0f judgment.” Had he inserted the heli0centric p0siti0ns in the chart 0f the af0resaid Kaiser, his err0rs 0f judgment w0uld have been less glaring; f0r the heli0centric Mars in Aries has

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians S7

played a str0ng part thus far, and s0 has the heli0centric Mer- cury. The test 0f all judgment must be “d0es it w0rk?” We use electricity in 0ur h0uses, it w0rks. That we d0 n0t kn0w what it is, 0r why it acts as it d0es, d0es n0t prevent 0ur using it. This is my p0siti0n in regard t0 inserting the heli0centric p0siti0ns in the ge0centric chart and c0nsidering them as sen- sitive p0ints, exactly as we c0nsider the midheaven and the ascendant, and the cuspal p0ints: 1 d0 n0t kn0w why they w0rk. 1 am c0ntent t0 have pr0ved in hundreds 0f charts that they d0.

If we are n0t t0 fl0under in a m0rass 0f destructive fatal- ism, we must first and f0rem0st c0nsider the chart 0f birth as indicative 0f the character manifested in a given envir0nment, and the influence that that envir0nment will have up0n that character in the 0pp0rtunities and temptati0ns that it presents. F0r granting this, 0ne understanding his 0wn character and the nature 0f the temptati0ns that he must face, bec0mes truly the “ruler 0f his stars,” 0r the c0ntr0ller 0f his envir0nment, and c0nsequently 0f his destiny. There is n0 r00m f0r a dis- tressing denial 0f free will, and a weak laying 0f the blame 0n Fate here; that is the c0ward’s excuse. Astr0l0gy has n0 r00m f0r such belief: f0r what the h0r0sc0pe sh0ws is but the h0use 0f the In-Dweller, the t00ls 0f the w0rkman, and the place 0f his lab0r,

T0 this end the ge0centric p0siti0ns, midheaven, and as- cendant in a c0rrectly calculated chart are equally imp0rtant fact0rs; the cusps 0f the h0uses, radically and pr0gressed, 0nly little less imp0rtant; and these twenty-0ne fact0rs and their dedinati0ns then bec0me indicative 0f envir0nment, and the natural and hereditary influences 0f that envir0nment. That is—man as a citizen 0f the earth. But the c0nstructive as- tr0l0ger realizes that man can, and may, transcend that en- vir0nment and heredity; there is within himself what we call “c0nscience,” 0r c0nsci0usness 0f his greater p0ssibilities, He rec0gnizes man as a p0int in the Great C0nsci0usness, in the

K0sm0s, an infinitesimal citizen 0f the universe, and it is man in that relati0nship, in the unf0ldment and p0ssibility 0f d0m- inating his envir0nment, that is b0died f0rth in the heli0centric p0siti0ns at the exact m0ment 0f his birth, which then be- c0me sensitive p0ints in the ge0centric chart, whereby he is influenced exactly as he is influenced by the ascendant, mid- heaven and h0use cusps, and their aspects, that have n0 actual existence as b0dies, and yet are 0f great imp0rt t0 the c0smic man.

Emers0n rec0gnized this c0smic man when he wr0te “as- tr0l0gy, that was a step in the right directi0n—it tied man t0 the system, the farthest star felt him and he felt that star.” Sibley hinted at this c0mbined system, when he sp0ke 0f the squares and 0pp0siti0ns 0f Mercury and Venus t0 the Sun. The 0lder writers refer t0 the malign influence 0f a retr0- grade Venus and Mercury: the inferi0r c0njuncti0n finding the heli0centric p0siti0ns always 0pp0sed t0 the ge0centric; thus the material man (0r the envir0nmental state), and the c0smic man acting at variance, 0r the mind 0r the em0ti0ns at war with each 0ther.

Wheref0re, is it m0re reas0nable t0 believe that the true p0siti0ns 0f the planets in their relati0n t0 the Sun as the center 0f 0ur system are thr0ugh that Sun sensitized (0r ph0t0graphed) in the chart 0n the day 0f birth and in the days that immediately succeed birth: 0r that causes that are set up 0n the days pri0r t0 birth in an inverse 0rder are t0 be used as indicati0ns 0f the devel0pment 0f the individual after birth? F0r if 0ne 90es backward in “c0nverse prenatal directi0ns” t0 the days immediately preceding birth, what then bec0mes 0f the chart 0f c0ncepti0n, the “prenatal lunar ep0ch”? Are we t0 have tw0 separate kinds 0f ante-natal causes?

The prenatal lunar ep0ch, 0r chart 0f c0ncepti0n, sh0ws th0se c0nditi0ns that dev0lve up0n the individual pri0r t0 birth; it sh0ws physical def0rmities that are inherent far m0re dearly than the birth chart. Is this t0 yield t0 the c0nverse?

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians S9

And what are we t0 say 0f th0se befuddled minds that advance “c0nverse prenatal lunar-ep0chal directi0ns”? In 0ther w0rds, t0 th0se wh0 try t0 tell us that physical events besetting us n0w are traceable 0nly t0 th0se days that antedate c0ncepti0n by six weeks 0r tw0 m0nths. Reas0n and c0mm0n sense f0rbid!

One is willing t0 grant that the chart 0f birth sh0ws the character and envir0nment, 0pp0rtunities, and the less0n that this life is meant t0 teach the individual; 0ne is willing t0 c0n- cede that the chart 0f c0ncepti0n (the prenatal lunar chart) sh0ws the physical m0uld, the desires, the astral nature 0f the individual; and that events that str0ngly mark the life sh0uld be sh0wn b0th in the birth figure and the c0ncepti0nal chart. One w0uld even c0ncede that the pr0gressed genesc0pe, 0r c0ncepti0nal chart, sh0uld in a measure parallel the birth chart. And 0ne might even 90 further and credit the eastem nati0ns when they state that a man is tw0 years 0ld 0n his first birth- day, 0n the p0ssibility that they may here p0ssess a great truth, and that there is a prenatal s0lar chart that fumishes the truly e90istic equati0n: that this is the 0ccult truth that is back 0f the cust0m 0f heredity and entail thr0ugh the male line. If there is such a prenatal s0lar chart, then it must c0me thr0ugh the line 0f descent 0f the father, and alth0ugh science has n0t yet granted that this is s0, we may p0stulate that there may be a m0ment pri0r t0 c0ncepti0n when the p0tential e90 takes f0rm, and that this must antedate the prenatal lunar chart, and be a p0sitive chart, 0r a s0lar chart.

Then if 0ne sh0uld accept this hyp0thesis, and later scien- tific research sh0uld pr0ve that there is a peri0d 0f incubati0n in the male line, we sh0uld have a triple chart—we sh0uld have the b0dy (0r the “N0t-1’) 0f the birth figure; the astral mind 0r em0ti0nal chart (the “relati0n”) 0f the prenatal lunar; and the s0lar 0r e90istic equati0n (the “1”) 0f the pre- natal s0lar. In 0ther w0rds, we w0uld have the envir0nmental equati0n, the equati0n 0f heredity thr0ugh the m0ther, and the

equati0n 0f e90ity thr0ugh the father. The man, the m0tive p0wer 0f his desires, and his earthly h0use; and then we c0uld truly say, “this is a great spirit in a p00r h0use,” 0r “this is a p00r spirit in a great h0use.” T0 such wh0 may wish t0 ex- periment with this prenatal s0lar chart, as a hyp0thesis, it is simply d0ne. Take the exact l0ngitude t0 sec0nds 0f the birth Sun, calculating the exact time when the Sun held this l0ngi- tude (t0 m0ments and sec0nds) in the year pri0r t0 birth, in 0ther w0rds, a reversed s0lar rev0luti0n.

But f0r all practical purp0ses en0ugh is t0 be leamed fr0m the figure 0f the birth al0ne, and it is with the directi0ns 0f this chart al0ne that 1 shall deal, as interpreted by a c0mbina- ti0n 0f the ge0centric and heli0centric p0siti0ns placed in a ge0centric figure, treating b0th exactly as the same sensitive p0ints in the chart.

The English manual 0n “Directi0ns and Directing,” Pearce’s “Textb00k,” and Bailey’s “Prenatal Ep0ch,” fumish very interesting examples where c0nverse prenatal, c0nverse prenatal lunar, and extranatal directi0ns, have been c00ked up t0 acc0unt f0r events that, if 0ne places the heli0centric p0si- ti0ns als0 in the scheme, bec0me immediately dear by 0rdinary direct pr0gressi0ns. The pr00f 0f any the0ry is its w0rking 0ut. B0th Pearce and Wilde qu0te the chart 0f Prince Rud0lph 0f Austria, Wilde t0 pr0ve that his new aspects ex- plain the cause 0f death; Pearce that the c0njuncti0n with Regulus 0f the Sun 0ccasi0ned it. Wilde asks us t0 believe that the qui-tricibinile 0f S6 degrees 0f Neptune t0 the M00n caused this tragic death. If 0ne inserts the heli0centric radical places and 0bserves that the heli0 Mars is in Capric0m afflict- ing Uranus 0n the ascendant, and exactly sesquadrating the heli0centric Jupiter j0ined t0 Uranus in the ascendant with the radical Mars applying t0 the 0pp0siti0n 0f Jupiter, 0ne w0uld naturally expect death thr0ugh vi0lence, plus the heli0 Venus in Sagittarius in square t0 Neptune in Pisces fr0m the h0use 0f death, indicating the er0tic-ex0tic circumstance.

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 6I

Wilde was a c0nscienti0us w0rker, wh0 tried hard t0 find -

in the new aspects a reas0n f0r the strange lapses 0f directi0ns. But when 0ne puts this new series t0 the test, in the light 0f the variati0ns between the heli0centric and ge0centric p0siti0ns 0f the same superi0r planet, 0ne perceives that his new aspects are acc0unted f0r. The average distance between the tw0 p0siti0ns 0f Neptune (when square Sun) is ab0ut 2I4 de- grees; 0f Uranus, ab0ut 334 degrees; 0f Satum, ab0ut 6 de- grees; 0f Jupiter, ab0ut I2 degrees; and these acc0unt f0r much 0f his deducti0ns, based as they were up0n his ex- periences. This als0 explains the c0nverse sec0ndary direc- ti0nal idea, especially where the birth p0siti0ns sh0w aspects 0f Sun t0 the superi0rs that are n0t exactly semi-square square 0f sesquare at birth, and the “c0nverse” measures exactly t0 the heli0centric p0siti0ns. This can be easily dem0nstrated in 0ne’s 0wn chart. The heli0 explains. And this applies even t0 Mr. Bailey, wh0 has made a w0nderfully accurate and helpful dem0nstrati0n 0f the prenatal lunar ep0ch, and pr0ves his case therein l0gically, except f0r the err0r 0f pr0ving t00 much in striving f0r the “c0nverse prenatal lunar.”

And because s0me 0f the ab0ve-menti0ned able astr0l0gers in the English j0umals 0f astr0l0gy have with a great blaz0n- ing 0f trumpets given “authentic” figures 0f the birth 0f the late L0rd Kitchener, 1 have ch0sen this as example, f0r with the excepti0n 0f the figure published by Raphael in the I9I7 epheremis, they are all inc0rrect, and all need “c0nverse sec0ndary directi0ns” and c0nverse prenatal lunar ep0chal directi0nal b0sh t0 “pr0ve” them.

Tam indebted t0 Mr. Hazelrigg f0r this data, fumished t0 him by L0rd Kitchener himself when Mr. Hazelrigg cast his chart in December, I915.

This is p0ssibly unf0rtunate f0r b0th the August, I915, issue 0f M0dem Astr0l0gy, which gives it as ab0ut 7 a. M., and f0r the July, I9I6, issue 0f the British J0umal 0f Astr0l-

0gy, which gives the birth as 1.48 Pp. M., and adds “subsequent events have entirely c0nfirmed my estimate.” F0r Kitchener himself stated it t0 Mr. Hazelrigg as “ab0ut half an h0ur after midnight” 0n June 24, I8SO, and it 0ccurred in Lat. S2° 26’ N., 9° 28 W.

Calculated acc0rding t0 Mr. Bailey’s epech 0f the first 0rder, this is a regular masculine ep0ch that yields a birth time

0f 0.I4 A. M. true l0cal time.* And when we find that at the time 0f the l0ss 0f the “Hampshire” Satum had again retumed t0 the dedinati0n 0f the radical ascendant and its 0wn radical dedinati0n, the ascendant at birth being in exact c0njuncti0n

with the heli0centric sensitive p0int 0f Satum, it l00ks as if the p0siti0n pr0ved itself, and as if the ascendant were I3° 39’ Aries in p0int 0f fact.

Satum rising in Aries acc0unts f0r the peculiar reserve and the s0mewhat harsh c0untenance, and his bachel0r life: and the rising Uranus f0r his ind0mitable will and daring in- n0vati0ns. His success abr0ad is sh0wn thr0ugh the M00n in the ninth trine Uranus and trecile the heli0 Satum; and the M00n’s applicati0n t0 the 0pp0siti0n 0f the Sun directly sep- arating fr0m the p0ints sensitized by the heli0centric Mars in 2I% Vir90, and the heli0 Jupiter in 2734 Vir90 w0uld sh0w danger 0n and by the water, and als0 shipwreck and treachery thr0ugh empl0yees; what it d0es n0t sh0w is death thr0ugh any expl0si0n. Hist0ry will be apt t0 sh0w that if Kitchener met his death at this time, it was n0t thr0ugh the expl0si0n itself, but thr0ugh treachery.

In I886, under Sun pr0g. t0 sextile Mars heli0 pr0g., Kitchener was made G0vem0r 0f the Red Sea, Mars heli0 als0 appr0aching the trine 0f the pr0gressed M. C. And in fact fr0m I879 when he was made Vice-C0nsul at Erzer0um under Asc. Pr0g. t0 sextile the radical p0int 0f the heli0centric Satum, t0 I884 his rise was sl0w but steady; and after I892, when the sextile 0f the M. C. pr0gressed t0 the radix heli0 p0int 0f Satum was f0rmed, the train 0f directi0ns t0 this p0int began and culminated in I898 with the Omdurman vic- t0ry, when Satum f0rmed the last sextile 0f its pr0gressed ge0centric place t0 the pr0gressed M. C. at the same time that Uranus heli0centric radix sensitive p0int made the sextile 0f the pr0gressed ascendant. This year als0 f0und Mercury pr0g. trine Uranus radix; the sensitive p0int 0f the heli0 Mer- cury in the sensitive p0int 0f the heli0 Mercury in the M. C. Radix having the trine 0f the pr0gressed Venus; and the heli0 pr0g. Mercury pr0gressed t0 the exact c0njuncti0n 0f the heli0 radix Jupiter and the pr0gressed Venus. The pr0g. M00n had been passing 0ver all these p0ints during the pre-

ceding m0nths, and had the parallel 0f Venus when September 2, I898, the transits sh0wed str0ng 900d. Neptune sextiled the M. C. at birth, and the transit 0f Neptune trined the pr0g- ressed p0int at this date; Uranus sextiled by transit all the p0ints 0f Jupiter, Venus, and Mercury, b0th radix and pr0g., and als0 the pr0gressed M00n, Satum transited the trine 0f the asc. and its 0wn place, and Jupiter transited the radix 7th and pr0g. Sth trining fr0m these p0ints the pr0gressed M. C.

These aspects t0 M. C. and Asc. seem effectually t0 disp0se 0f the “authentic” h0r0sc0pes published b0th by the ‘British J0umal and M0dem Astr0l0gy, due t0 their imperfect systems 0f directing; and t0 make the c0rrectness 0f Raphael’s chart, which gives 23° Aries rising, 0pen t0 questi0n.

In I888 a piece 0f shell at Handub0n made the right eye rigid: this is in itself a characteristic 0f Aries rising, and the rising Satum and Uranus in this sign w0uld indine t0 this, as Uranus afflicts Mercury 0n the cusp 0f the 3rd in Gemini. During the Summer 0f I888 the M00n squared the Sun c0n- juncti0n Mercury in 8° Le0; paralleled Uranus and afflicted its 0wn radical place and that 0f Jupiter heli0centric. The p0siti0ns 0f Mercury als0 afflicted all 0f these p0ints; and the transits 0f Satum als0 j0ined the Sun, squared the M00n, and sesquared the 0thers; and Uranus 0pp0sed the radix asc. and Satum; Jupiter’s transit als0 sesquaring the same p0ints as Uranus afflicted. All these p0int t0 the sight and t0 the right eye, the Sun being the m0re heavily attacked.

During the last d0zen years L0rd Kitchener limped; the date 0f this injury is given as N0vember I6, I9O3; 1 have als0 seen it given as I9O6, August. It is p0ssible that there was m0re than 0ne injury. In I9O3 the pr0gressed Sun was c0n- juncti0n the radical Mars in 23° Le0. Mars had pr0gressed t0 the square 0f the radical M00n in Sagittarius, and the heli0centric Mars pr0g. t0 the 0pp0siti0n 0f the heli0 Satum; the pr0gressed M00n at this time having the afflicti0n 0f the heli0centric sensitive p0int 0f Uranus. These directi0ns all

p0int t0 accident, and thr0ugh a h0rse; Jupiter ruled the I2th at birth and was in the 6th heli0centrically, and the M00n passed thr0ugh Sagittarius, paralleling Mars als0.

The transits f0r N0vember I6th find the ge0centric Uranus trine the Sun pr0gressed; the heli0 Uranus transiting exactly the radix M00n. The ge0centric transit 0f Jupiter squared the radical Mercury and semisquared the places 0f Uranus and the heli0 radical Mercury; while the heli0centric transit 0f Jupiter thr0ugh Pisces als0 was c0nj0ined t0 the pr0g. Mercury exactly square radical M00n. These p0siti0ns p0int exactly t0 the leg and the right leg, as the M00n in Sagittarius is ab0ve the earth, and m0st 0f the transits are fr0m Aquarius, Pisces, and Sagittarius. That it resulted in a permanent limp is indicated by the heli0 transit 0f Satum thr0ugh 934 Aquar- ius, which afflicted the radical M00n and pr0gressed Mars and Jupiter; the ge0centric Satum transit affecting 0nly the place sensitized by the radix heli0centric Mars. The transits 0f the ge0centric Mars afflicted Satum and the pr0g. Sun and Mars; and the heli0 transits 0f Mars in I2I4 Aquarius exactly ses- quared the heli0centric radical Jupiter. This strikes t0 the m0ment; n0 wide 0rb is needed here. It is perhaps c0mplex, in that it deals with twenty-eight elements in the radix and the same in the pr0gressed, with sixteen transits t0 each. But life is c0mplex, what w0uld y0u? And it is certainly less c0m- plex in that y0u have all the elements in the day 0f birth and in the pr0gressed f0r the year at “a day f0r a year”: and need n0t 90 backward t0 days pri0r t0 birth and pri0r t0 c0n- cepti0n and what-n0t!

F0r the sad end 0f L0rd Kitchener 0n June sth, I9I6, there remains perhaps an0ther w0rd t0 be said by future his- t0rians. We have 0nly rep0rt t0 say that at ab0ut 8 p. m. west 0f the Orkneys the ship was wrecked. The pr0gressed M00n had reached the trine 0f the radix Jupiter, and the sesquare 0f the heli0centric Jupiter pr0g., t0gether with the sesquare 0f the pr0gressed heli0 Venus, and the parallels 0f Neptune and

Uranus. All these p0int t0 sudden accident, danger, b0dily injury, and this same aspect was current in I888 when he in- jured his eye, and the sesquare 0f Uranus in I9O3, when the leg was hurt. The ruler, Mars, had pr0gressed heli0centrically t0 the 0pp0siti0n 0f Satum in 20° Libra, b0th 0f these p0ints having the sesquare 0f the pr0gressed Sun and the sesquadrate 0f Neptune, in its tum 0pp0sing the Sun. This p0ints far m0re t0 treachery thr0ugh a supp0sed friend, t0 injury t0 the head, t0 disappearance, than it d0es t0 death by expl0si0ns and t0 dr0wnings. One reading this chart w0uld fear m0re fr0m p0is0n, fr0m false friends, than 0ne w0uld fr0m wreck; th0ugh danger 0n the water is very dear. The sesquadrate 0f Satum f0rmed the last 0f this train which began in I9O9, and it w0uld be t0 the men 0f his acquaintance then that 0ne w0uld l00k f0r the 0rigin 0f this last bl0w.

T0 get nearer h0me we might menti0n Rev. Irl Hicks 0f St. L0uis, wh0, alth0ugh empl0ying the heli0centric system 0f f0recasts, has f0r the last three decades pr0gn0sticated a year in advance atm0spheric phen0mena that are unf0reseen by the pr0fessi0nal physicist even a few h0urs pri0r t0 its effect. Our G0vemment mete0r0l0gists have 0ccasi0nally taken a fling at l0ng distance f0recasts. Incidently Rev. Hicks, in I9OO, predicted the Galvest0n Fl00d as f0ll0ws: “One 0f the decided st0rm peri0ds f0r September (I9OI) will fall ab0ut the 6th t0 rith.... It will be wise t0 heed the signals 0f West Indian hurricanes at this time.” He then sent at his 0wn, and n0t G0vemment expense, c0pies 0f his f0recast t0 all p0stmasters al0ng the Gulf c0ast, calling their attenti0n t0 the waming which the after event—determined a year in advance ~—fully justified. The Weather Bureau map 0f the Galvest0n hurricane sh0ws same t0 have struck the Fl0rida c0ast 0n September 6th, thence thr0ugh the Gulf 0f Mexic0, central Texas, and veering eastward, t0 have left 0ur territ0ry in the New F0undland district 0n the I2th, which must impress 0ne as being m0re than a c0incidence, and a pretty d0se verificati0n 0f the exact peri0d stated in the dates given. The Weather Bureau sensed n0thing 0f the disturbance until it was already under way, yet with such testim0nies as these ever repeating themselves in supp0rt 0f 0ur the0ry the G0vemment sup- p0rted mete0r0l0gists ridicule the idea 0f l0ng distance f0re- casts.

C0nsidering the vast area 0f this c0untry, and c0nsequently the interval 0f time required in transit f0r shipments 0f f00d- stuffs acr0ss the c0ntinent, the necessity f0r l0ng range f0re- casts is quite apparent. H0wever, there sh0uld be n0 anim0s- ity between the adv0cate 0f material d0ctrines and the dev0tee 0f astral c0rresp0ndences, f0r there is a meeting p0int where they might be 0f mutual advantage in the diffusi0n 0f kn0wl- edge relating t0 causes and effects.

The great Kepler appears t0 have been fully aware 0f the

universally existing prejudice against encr0achments up0n 0ld established the0ries when he said, after the c0mpleti0n 0f his three fam0us laws 90veming and regulating the planets, that “the b00k c0ntaining them might well wait a century f0r the reader, as G0d had waited six th0usand years f0r an 0b- server.”

Fr0m rem0test antiquity it has been 0bserved that when planets are in c0njuncti0n, 0r at certain angles in l0ngitude with the Sun, they pr0duce atm0spheric c0nditi0ns peculiar t0 their nature and quality. The ancients attributed these at- m0spheric changes t0 the acti0n 0f light, and c0ntended that each c0l0r 0f the s0lar spectrum had certain qualities 0f its 0wn. It was 0bserved that the p0sitive red ray c0rresp0nded with c0nfigurati0ns 0f Mars, and that the negative blue ray pred0minated when Satum was exerting his influence. The intelligence 0f this hyp0thesis 0nce fully verified, it became but a matter 0f inducti0n f0r th0se mystic w0rthies t0 c0ntinue their anal0gy t0 the seven functi0nal planes 0f vibrati0n as in- terpreted thr0ugh the 0ther planets, and f0rmulate th0se d0c- trines which have been handed d0wn t0 p0sterity. Indeed the Egyptians were s0 apt in their kn0wledge regarding the vibra- t0ry f0rce 0f light that they applied it with great facility in the cure 0f diseases.

Every material partide gives a vibrat0ry resp0nse acc0rd- ing t0 the c0l0r value 0f the rays impressed up0n it. The vi- brati0n thus induced manifests itself in the atm0sphere, hence the energetic and stimulating red rays engender heat and dr0ught in the earth which react 0n the atm0sphere, and ele- vate the temperature. The blue ray, c00l and m0ist, 0n the c0ntrary decreases temperature, increases m0isture and pr0- duces dec0mp0siti0n. The lumin0us principle is everywhere —~that 0f life itself and being unified in the Sun—s0urce 0f life and heat. The s0lar 0rb then is the centre 0f attracti0n thr0ugh which the magnetic vibrati0ns 0f the planets manifest themselves. And s0, as the tiny ray 0f light is reflected t0 us,

d0 we find blended and fully capable 0f analyzati0n the astral principles 0f the universe.

While general rules regarding the effects 0f the vari0us c0nfigurati0ns and p0siti0ns 0f the planets are given in the astr0-phil0s0phical text-b00ks, but few writers have dealt with fundamental principles bey0nd the subject 0f aspects— when planets are in c0njuncti0n, parallel 0f dedinati0n, quad- rature, 0pp0siti0n, etc., transiting the equat0r 0r tr0pics, 0r being stati0nary in apparent m0ti0n. Assuming that m0st students are m0re 0r less familiar with these we shall c0ntent 0urselves with c0nsidering the nature and quality 0f each planet.

The Sun, c0ntaining the seven prismatic c0l0rs, is c0n- sidered the prime m0ver 0f the atm0sphere, as in every s0lar ray reflected is c0mprised the seven creative principles. Hence when the Sun is in maj0r aspect with any planet the individual nature and quality 0f such planet are c0nj0ined with the ter- restrial magnetism. In all s0lar c0nfigurati0ns the Sun sign must be c0nsidered. The pred0minating c0l0r 0f the Sun is 0range.

The M00n being very swift in m0ti0n f0rms during each

day many aspects with 0ther planets, and while s0lar and

mutual c0nfigurati0ns give a specific character t0 the atm0s- phere, the M00n marks the changes which 0ccur thr0ugh0ut the day. She 90vems m0isture generally, and frequently has- tens atm0spheric changes by translating light t0 tw0 planets c0mpleting an aspect between themselves. Her transits 0ver the vari0us planets, and aspects t0 th0se in the equat0r 0r tr0pics, sh0uld be carefully n0ted. The the0ry 0f lunar f0re- casts is manifestly wr0ng, as predicti0ns sh0uld n0t be ren- dered fr0m the Sun 0r M00n s0lely, n0r can any 0ne rule be taken as determinative, f0r the testim0nies surr0unding any 0ne peri0d are m0re 0r less c0mplex alth0ugh s0me pred0m- inant aspect will aff0rd a dear key.

Mercury, wh0 in ancient myth0l0gy was called “Mes-

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 7I

senger 0f the G0ds,” is in nature c0ld and dry, and 90vems the winds. Being c0nvertible, he receives the impressi0n 0f any planet with which he is c0nj0ined 0r c0nfigurated. His c0n- juncti0n with the Sun pr0duces great winds, m0re particularly when retr0grade. C0ntinued 0bservati0ns verify the fact that many 0f 0ur hurricanes in the Mississippi Valley c0incide with such c0njuncti0ns. In c0ld seas0ns Mercury 0ften pr0duces sleet; in warm weather his disturbances are m0re manifest in- land, the wind disturbances 0riginating m0stly fr0m the desert lands 0r where the average rainfall is bel0w n0rmal. Thus, in the Ariz0na desert the sand st0rms increase near a c0n- juncti0n 0f Sun and Mercury. When Mercury is c0nfigurated _ with Mars 0r Uranus high winds and st0rmy c0nditi0ns are als0 0bserved t0 0ccur fr0m west t0 east, but attaining their maxima in the interi0r and diminishing in vel0city t0ward the c0ast 0r l0wlands. The pred0minating c0l0r 0f Mercury is vi0let, and he imparts negative electricity t0 the atm0sphere, which acc0unts f0r the excess 0f m0isture f0ll0wing high temperatures when c0nj0ined with the Sun.

Venus attracts the s0uth winds, pr0duces humidity, bar0- metric depressi0n, and d0wnfall, f0ll0wed by dr0p in tempera- ture, hence in winter her c0nfigurati0ns with the Sun devel0p m0isture, dr0p in temperature, and eventually tuming t0 sn0w. The same c0nditi0ns prevail when Venus transits the equat0r. When Venus adds her rays t0 0ther st0rm testim0nies, fl00ds frequently f0ll0w. Her pred0minating c0l0r is yell0w, and she generates p0sitive electricity.

’ Mars attracts the west winds, quickly elevates the tempera- ture and pr0m0tes dr0ught, 0ften s0 destructive t0 cr0ps. When with the Sun the rays 0f the s0lar 0rb are driven int0 the earth with greater energy. The greatest dr0ught 0ccurs when Jupiter is c0nnected with Mars. Kn0wing the buming nature 0f Mars 0ne may readily assume why Mars, when p0sited in the f0urth angle in the summer charts causes fires destructive 0f pr0perty and f0rests, the latter m0re s0 when in

Le0. In summer such spells 0f heat fr0m the Mars influence are frequently f0ll0wed by marked reacti0ns, thus t0 rest0re the equilibrium. The ray 0f Mars is red and generates an excess 0f p0sitive electricity. Observati0ns sh0w maximum quantities 0f nitr0gen in the atm0sphere under this influence.

Jupiter m0ves the n0rth winds and resists m0isture, ex- cept he be situated in signs 0f that nature. An increase 0f 0z0ne is n0ted, with elevati0n 0f temperature. Bar0metric pressure is usually ab0ve the average; the air bec0mes serene, invi90rating, healthful and dear, all0wing 0bjects t0 be 0b- served at greater distances than usual, The ray 0f Jupiter is indi90, its nature between that 0f Mars and Satum, each 0f which affect it str0ngly, the f0rmer by heat, the latter by c0ld and aque0us vap0rs.

Satum attracts the east winds, pr0m0tes aque0us vap0rs and heavy d0uds, decrease 0f temperature acc0rding t0 ge0- graphical l0cati0n and seas0n, with heaviness 0f air. Atm0s- pheric disturbances under Satum are sl0w but general in their effects, and m0re manifest in the l0wlands fr0m west t0 east. The ray 0f Satum is blue, imparts negative electricity and an excess 0f hydr0gen in the atm0sphere.

Uranus is p0werfully magnetic and imparts negative elec- tricity, having very much the same influence as Satum, th0ugh m0re sudden. A general dr0p in temperature is 0bserved, the air bec0mes bleak and raw, with bar0metric depressi0n and subsequent precipitati0n. C0ld waves invariably f0ll0w. The c0l0r ray 0f Uranus is the extreme 0f the actinic vi0let.

Neptune’s influence, 0wing t0 its watery character, leads 0ne t0 presupp0se an excess 0f m0isture 0r d0wnfall, but 0b- servati0ns fr0m I862 t0 I88I sh0w the c0ntrary in England. During 0ur limited 0bservati0ns it appears t0 pr0duce rapid changes and frequently heavy gales 0f wind, als0 indining t0 humidity and atm0spheric pressure bey0nd n0rmal. Its ray is the extreme 0f the cal0rific red. Each 0f these latter planets when c0nnected with Mars has been 0bserved t0 set up Hert-

zian waves (kn0wn t0 wireless 0perat0rs as “statics”), m0re especially if Mercury be at the same time c0nfigurated with them.

In all weather f0recasts ge0detic c0nsiderati0ns enter int0 the pr0blem, als0 time all0wance fer st0rm f0rmati0ns that require fr0m tw0 t0 f0ur days t0 make their c0ntinental transit. Bef0re pr0gn0sticati0ns by astr0-mete0r0l0gy can be l0calized with any great facility, the ge0graphy, t0p0graphy, and ge0l0gical f0rmati0n 0f vari0us l0calities must be deter- mined. F0r instance, New Y0rk City, being surr0unded by a large b0dy 0f water and subject t0 a m0ist atm0sphere, is manifestly sensible t0 the c0nfigurati0ns 0f the M00n. The reas0n f0r ascribing the rulership 0f the sign Cancer t0 New Y0rk is 0bvi0us. While the s0uth p0rti0n 0f New Y0rk is much nearer the sea level than the n0rthem part, the f0rmer is m0re subject t0 humidity than the latter, hence we frequently 0bserve tw0 existing c0nditi0ns 0f atm0sphere at the same time. Th0se wh0 have witnessed the vast variety 0f atm0s- pheric c0nditi0ns in that city can better appreciate the sense 0f the ab0ve.

As m0isture attracts m0isture general st0rms in transit acr0ss the c0ntinent are frequently diverted fr0m their c0urse by b0dies 0f water, hence it frequently happens that disturb- ances m0ving n0rthward al0ng the Atlantic C0ast fr0m the Gulf 0r Cape Hatteras will unexpectedly shift their c0urse t0 the Great Lakes. Because 0f the Mississippi being the largest river inland, the surr0unding atm0sphere charged with m0is- ture and the m0untain ranges 0n the west fumishing further advantages f0r c0ndensati0n there0f, 0ne may readily infer the reas0n why aspects 0perate there s0 d0se t0 time.

In Maine, where the f0rests s0 quickly attract m0isture, the rainfall averages 4S inches per year. At Neal Bay, Wash., in 0ne year I4O inches have been rec0rded, but in certain parts 0f Ariz0na the yearly rainfall seld0m exceeds tw0 inches. Thus in f0recasting the general character 0f the weather f0r

any time due c0nsiderati0n must be given t0 the l0cality. In the n0rtheastem states an aspect 0f Satum might indicate precipitati0n, and the east wind w0uld c0ntinue t0 bl0w f0r s0me h0urs until it met an0ther current 0f air near Cape Hatteras. The st0rm w0uld then c0mmence t0 0perate, sweep- ing n0rthward and n0t reaching the n0rtheast states until a day 0r tw0 after the aspect is exact.

Even under the c0njuncti0n 0f Mercury with Sun, which is m0re p0tent in the Mississippi Valley in causing vi0lent wind disturbances and st0rm centres, the gales may n0t reach the eastem c0ast until tw0 0r three days after the aspect. The wind might attain a vel0city 0f I2S miles per h0ur inland where this c0mbinati0n is m0re effective, but as it neared the m0ist atm0sphere 0f the c0ast might be reduced t0 a vel0city 0f 6O t0 7O miles per h0ur.

In c0nsidering Jupiter, which signifies the N. and N.W. winds, his aspects in winter tend t0 l0wer temperature in the east, as these winds reach us fr0m the sn0w-dad secti0ns and the c0ld gr0unds inland. In summer these same winds, f0r 0ur eastem secti0ns, sh0uld be the reverse, as the s0il is then baked and dry. The Satum east winds in the winter m0nths

‘f0r the Atlantic States indine t0 high temperatures al0ng

the eastem c0ast, because c0ming fr0m 0ff the water-——which is warmer than the land at this peri0d 0f the year—and fr0m the Gulf Stream. But 0n reaching the interi0r the Satum winds, in passing 0ver the fr0sty earth, w0uld indine t0 l0w temperatures.

By the same reas0ning, things sh0uld be just the reverse al0ng the westem c0ast, as the east winds there c0me fr0m the c0ld heights 0f the R0ckies. There is a characteristic resp0n- siveness 0f atm0spheric phen0mena n0t 0nly t0 features 0f t0- p0graphy, but t0 ge0l0gical f0rmati0ns, The same aspect will thus act differently in different secti0ns 0f the c0untry acc0rd- ing t0 these c0nsiderati0ns, and astr0-mete0r0l0gy can be studied with pr0fit 0nly with a kn0wledge 0f these facts.

The rules 0f astr0-mete0r0l0gy cann0t be safely f0ll0wed with0ut these vari0us c0nsiderati0ns and a c0nversancy with weather physics generally: just as the astr0l0gian wh0 kn0ws the the0ry and practice 0f medicine will be able t0 apply the science t0 diagn0sis and treatment 0f disease with m0re facil- ity than the 0ne wh0 kn0ws naught 0f therapeutics; similarly, a kn0wledge 0f market p0tentials is necessary t0 make an in- telligent applicati0n t0 speculative ranges.

Astr0-mete0r0l0gy as applied t0 limited areas, such as the British Isles, is c0mparatively a “s0ft” pr0p0siti0n, and sh0uld be easily mastered and utilized. But 0ver these United States the temperature variati0ns m0re 0ften than n0t run t0 ex- tremes. F0r example, 0n January 27, I9I6, the therm0meter readings between Fl0rida and N0rth Dak0ta revealed merely a little differential variati0n 0f I34°! At New Y0rk the glass registered 66.5°; meanwhile the Westem States were gripped in a blizzard that sent the mercury bel0w zer0 in s0me l0cal- ities; at Havre, M0ntana, it reached S4° bel0w, and with a c0ld wave extending all the way fr0m Texas t0 the State 0f Washingt0n. At the preceding New M00n, calculated f0r New Y0rk, Cancer culminated with Libra 0n the ascendant, and the luminaries c0nj0ined in the l0wer meridian in 0pp0si- ti0n t0 an elevated Satum. The mean temperature f0r the m0nth was 5.2 ab0ve n0rmal, while the am0unt 0f precipita- ti0n rec0rded was 1.8 inches, 0r 3.79 inches bel0w n0rmal. This lunar peri0d c0ntained severi dear days, ten partly d0udy, and f0urteen heavily 0vercast—a very definite verificati0n 0f the Satum influence.

The figures f0r the f0ur s0lar ingresses sh0uld, h0wever, be adverted t0 bef0re res0lving judgment 0n lunati0ns. Thus,

in determining the variety 0f temperatures prevalent thr0ugh- 0ut the c0untry during the winter quarter f0rementi0ned, it is t0 be n0ted that at the ruling s0lar ingress at Washingt0n n0 planets 0ccupied the l0wer angle, Jupiter culminated, Venus was vespertine, with M00n rising in c0njuncti0n with Satum, but applying t0 a trine aspect 0f Jupiter. But the chart f0r the same ingress erected f0r 11O° west l0ngitude sh0ws Uranus culminating and Mars in f0urth angle, alth0ugh the latter tumed retr0grade very sh0rtly thereafter, and Mercury, the blizzard breeder, became stati0nary in the zenith (in Aquar- ius) 0n January 27th, within 0rb 0f an 0pp0siti0n t0 Mars at the ingress, and s0 gave testim0ny 0f the st0rm c0nditi0ns 0ver that area.

The p0siti0n 0f Mercury in the f0urth angle sextile Uranus at the Winter S0lstice 0f I887 enabled astr0-mete0r0l0gists even in Eur0pe t0 f0recast, m0nths in advance, 0ur remark- able blizzard 0f March I2, I888. The M. C. 0f this figure was the first degree 0f Gemini, with 5° Vir90 ascending. The M00n was setting in d0se square t0 Mercury, and Jupiter was 0pp0sed t0 Neptune fr0m fixed signs, and accentuated 0n the day 0f the blizzard with a lunati0n in the westem angle 0f the Ingress figure.

Until quite recently 0ur students, b0th here and abr0ad, have attempted t0 determine the character 0f 0ur weather fr0m charts erected f0r Washingt0n. This is manifestly a limited viewp0int, as figures sh0uld be calculated f0r each fifteen de- grees 0f the c0untry’s meridians, using the vari0us latitudes required. Obvi0usly the angles 0f a New Y0rk figure w0uld differ greatly fr0m 0ne bel0nging t0 the westem c0ast.

Charts f0r the quarterly phases 0f the M00n will supply additi0nal facts in pr0gn0sis, th0ugh the integrity 0f the ne0-

Fr0m a speculative-—and why n0t l0gical?—standp0int the sublunar system is n0t with0ut many physi0l0gical parallels. Thus, the rivers may be c0mpared t0 the arterial system, and all0tted t0 the rulership 0f Jupiter. New Orleans as the “Crescent City” and because 0f its ge0graphical characteristics, may be assigned t0 Cancer and the M00n; the R0ckies and the plains 0f Ariz0na might share the rulership 0f Le0; the c0al fields 0f Pennsylvania be placed under Satum, alth0ugh Pitts- burgh itself, 0n acc0unt 0f its steel industry, is str0ngly af- fected by the rays 0f Mars, Similarly, any planet in the f0urth angle as representing c0nditi0ns 0f the gr0und, must 0perate m0re decisively up0n the terrene batteries than if in 0ther p0siti0ns, and m0re f0rcibly in s0me secti0ns 0f the c0untry than in 0thers, acc0rding t0 a c0mbinati0n 0f planet and t0p0graphy, as f0r instance, Mars in the f0urth angle in a chart bearing rule 0ver Pennsylvania w0uld pr0bably excite atm0s- pheric phen0mena 0f a character signified by Mars c0njunc- ti0n Satum. And s0 0f 0ther territ0ries acc0rding t0 l0cal planetary rulership. The sum and substance 0f the matter is, the earth attracts 0r repels rays in acc0rdance with the nature ef its f0rmati0ns in specific l0calities, and as c0nsistently as man himself, up0n wh0m the stars impress their influence in measure and kind acc0rding t0 his c0nstituti0nal susceptibility. The imp0rtance 0f this p0int is n0t t0 be ign0red if weather pr0babilities are t0 be pr0perly weighed and analyzed.

If 0ur G0vemment mete0r0l0gists w0uld dev0te m0re time and give m0re attenti0n t0 c0smic causes, their tabulati0n 0f physical effects w0uld take 0n m0re significance and w0rk t0 a better purp0se.

In the applicati0n 0f the tenets 0f astr0-mete0r0l0gy general rules, th0ugh d0sely f0ll0wed, will give 0nly c0mpara- tive results. As in all fields 0f investigati0n, practice, 0bserva- ti0n, and the pr0f0und faculty 0f inducti0n, are essentials t0 reliable judgment. Astr0l0gy, as with 0ther avenues 0f science, calls f0r the specialist, as indicated in the fact that 0ne student temperamentally qualified f0r weather determinati0ns will reach averages which an0ther lacking in the faculty might strive in vain t0 emulate. And in this 0ne department 0f the stellar science the specialist is as necessary as he is in medicine, in art, in mechanics, etc., f0r he needs and sh0uld have careful training and experience in the d0main 0f general physics, the better t0 c0mprehend and t0 unravel the c0mplexities that s0 etemally 0btain between the regi0ns 0f the air and th0se 0f the earth.

The Bridge 0f Life

By Dr. Gr0rcz W. Carey

“A n0iseless, patient spider, 1 mari’d, where, 0n a little pr0m0nt0ry, it st00d, is0lated; Mark’d h0w, t0 expl0re the vacant, vast surr0unding, It launch’d f0rth filament, filament, filament, 0ut 0f itself; Ever unreeling them—ever tirelessly speeding them.

*And y0u, 0 my s0ul, where y0u stand,; Surr0unded, surr0unded, in measureless 0ceans 0f space, Ceaselessly musing, venturing, thr0wing—seeking the spheres,

t0 c0nnect them; Till the bridge y0u will need, be f0rm’d——till the ductile anch0r h0ld; Till the 90ssamer thread y0u fling, catch s0mewhere, 0 my s0ul.” —Watt WHITMAN.

HE statement by H0ly Writ that “man is c0nceived in sin and br0ught f0rth in iniquity” has a three. f0ld meaning, viz., chemical, physi0l0gical, and

# astr0l0gical. The translati0n fr0m the Hebrew

text as given is crude and misleading. The real meaning in

the 0riginal is, that the human embry0 remains nine m0nths in the female lab0rat0ry, thus falling sh0rt three m0nths 0f

c0mpleting a s0lar year, 0r s0ul year. Twelve represents a

c0mplete cirde..

The w0rd sin c0mes fr0m Schin, the 2Ist letter 0f the Hebrew alphabet, and means t0 fall sh0rt 0f c0mpleteness 0r understanding. In the Tar0t symb0l, 5, 0r Sin, is represented by the “Blind F00l,” 0ne lacking in wisd0m. “Br0ught f0rth

in iniquity” is merely a repetiti0n 0f the w0rds “b0m in sin.” Iniquity and inequity 0r unequal, mean the same. The an- cient Hebrews called M00n, Sin, because it gave light 0nly part 0f the time.

T0 acquire wisd0m that will enable the E90 in flesh t0 build a bridge acr0ss the three-m0nth gap, 0r space between the p0int 0f c0ncepti0n and birth, is the 0ne real pr0blem that c0nfr0nts S0ul 0n the material plane 0f expressi0n, The alchemists, seers, and astr0l0gians 0f all ages have wrestled with this pr0blem in their ceaseless endeav0rs t0 unravel the great mystery 0f man’s d0mini0n 0ver flesh. Whether it be the chemist seeking new c0mp0unds, the physi0l0gist search- ing and testing the fluids 0f the fearfully and w0nderfully made b0dy 0f man, 0r the alchemist pr0bing f0r the Elixir 0f Life—the Ich0r 0f the G0ds,—0r the astr0l0gian pulling and adjusting the etheric wires that criss-cr0ss the spaces in an eamest desire t0 make 900d and scan the statement “The wise man rules his stars,”—all, all are seeking t0 span the awful space that yawns between the ne0phyte and the Pr0mised Land 0f imm0rtality in the b0dy, where “in my flesh 1 shall see G0d,” and when and where he can truly say with the regenerated J0b, “1 have heard 0f thee by the hearing 0f the ear, but n0w mine eyes seeth thee.” Man must w0rk 0ut his 0wn salvati0n.

The bridge t0 be built acr0ss the three-m0nths space must have a mineral base 0r r0ck f0undati0n. “Th0u art Peter (petra, st0ne, 0r mineral), 0n thee will 1 build my church,” etc. Church is fr0m the sec0nd Hebrew letter, Beth, a h0use, temple, 0r church. The human b0dy is a h0use, temple, 0r church f0r S0ul. “Kn0w ye n0t that y0ur b0dies are the tem- ple (church) 0f G0d?”

There are twelve in0rganic mineral cell-salts in the human b0dy, and these minerals (st0nes in the temple) c0rresp0nd in vibrati0n t0 the twelve signs 0f the 20diac. During the nine m0nths 0f gestati0n the embry0 receives and appr0priates the

creative energies 0f nine 0f these salts, leaving three t0 be supplied after the parting 0f the umbilical c0rd. Take f0r example a native b0m February 22nd, with Sun’s entry int0 Pisces: The embry0 having begun its j0umey at the gate 0f Gemini and ne90tiated the nine gestat0ry signs, his bl00d vibrati0n at birth is thus deficient in the qualities 0f Pisces, Aries, and Taurus, as als0 in the chemical dynamics 0f ph0s- phate 0f ir0n, ph0sphate 0f p0tassium, and sulphate 0f s0dium -—the mineral bases respectively 0f the signs 0f this unc0m- pleted quadrant. In s0 far as his circulat0ry system may receive these needed builders, the health will be balanced and life pr0l0nged.

The chemical uni0n 0f these cell-salts with 0rganic matter, such as 0il, fibrin, albumen, etc., f0rms the vari0us tissues 0f the b0dy, and administers t0 the physi0l0gical needs as repre- sented by the Bridge, that the multiple cells may resp0nd m0re harm0ni0usly and c0mpletely t0 the magic t0uch 0f the Divine energy, just as the t0nes 0f a musical instrument are made the m0re mel0di0us thr0ugh a pr0perly skilled manipulati0n. And as bridge-building in a mechanical sense depends up0n the plans and specificati0ns 0f a c0mpetent civil engineer, s0 d0es the Bridge 0f Life depend up0n the astr0l0gian t0 chart and c0mpass the way.

The cell-salt kali muriaticum (P0tassium chl0ride) is the mineral w0rker 0f bl00d that f0rms fibrin and pr0perly dif- fuses it thr0ugh the tissues 0f the b0dy.

Kali mur m0lecules are principal agents used in the chem- istry 0f life t0 build fibrin int0 the human 0rganism. The skin that c0vers the face c0ntains the lines and angles that give expressi0n and thus differentiate 0ne pers0n fr0m an0ther.

In ven0us bl00d fibrin am0unts t0 three in 0ne th0usand parts; when the m0lecules 0f Kali mur fall bel0w the standard in the bl00d fibrin thickens, causing what is kn0wn as pleurisy, pneum0nia, catarrh, diphtheria, etc. When the circulati0n fails t0 thr0w 0ut the thickened fibrin via the glands 0r muc0us membrane, it may st0p the acti0n 0f the heart.

The chemistry 0f life answers the “Riddle 0f the Sphinx,” and writes ab0ve the temple d00r 0f investigati0n: “Let there be light.” There is n0 such thing as dead 0r inert. All is life. A crystal is an aggregati0n 0f living 0rganism. The base 0f all material manifestati0n is mineral. “Out 0f the dust (ashes 0r mineral) 0f earth physical man is made.”

The twelve mineral salts 0f lime, ir0n, p0tash, s0dium, silica and magnesium are the f0undati0n st0nes 0f every vis- ible f0rm 0f animal 0r vegetable. N0 tw0 f0rms 0f the dif- ferent species 0f animals have the same c0mbinati0n 0f this “r0ck f0undati0n,” but all have s0me 0f the same minerals.

It is quite as imp0rtant f0r a student 0f Bi0chemistry t0 understand the pr0cess by which: certain cell-salts 0perate t0 supply a deficiency as it is t0 kn0w what a particular symp- t0m calls f0r.

Elastic fibre, the chief 0rganic substance in rubber, is f0rmed by a chemical uni0n 0f the flu0ride 0f lime with albu- men, 0il, etc. Theref0re, we find this salt d0minant in the elastic fibre 0f the b0dy, in the enamel 0f teeth and c0nnective tissue.

A lack 0f this salt in pr0per am0unt causes relaxed c0ndi- ti0n 0f muscular tissue, falling 0f the w0mb and varic0se veins. S0metimes there is a n0n-functi0nal c0mbinati0n 0f this salt with 0il and albumen which f0rms a s0lid dep0sit, causing swellings 0f st0ny hardness; it is a s0rt 0f inc0mplete fibre with 0ther lime salts and vitiated fluids 0f the b0dy.

The imaginati0n might easily c0nceive the idea that these delicate infinitesimal fibres are strings 0f the Human Harp, and that m0lecular minerals are the fingers 0f infinite Energy striking n0tes 0f s0me Divine Anthem.

The white fibres 0f nerves and musdes need the dynamic acti0n 0f Magnesia Ph0sphate especially t0 keep them in pr0per tune, 0r functi0n, f0r by its chemical acti0n 0n albumen the special fluid f0r white nerve 0r musde fibre is f0rmed. When the supply 0f this salt falls bel0w the standard, cramps, sharp sh00ting pains 0r s0me spasm0dic c0nditi0n prevails. Such sympt0ms are simply calls 0f nature f0r m0re magnesia.

The impulsive traits 0f Le0 pe0ple are symb0led in the pulse, which is a reflex 0f heart thr0bs.

The ph0sphate 0f magnesia, in bi0chemic therapeutics, is the remedy f0r all spasm0dic impulsive sympt0ms. This salt supplies the deficient w0rker 0r builder in such cases and thus rest0res n0rmal c0nditi0ns. A lack 0f muscular f0rce, 0r nerve vi90r, indicates a disturbance in the 0perati0n 0f the heart cell-salt, magnesia ph0sphate, which gives the “Li0n’s spring,” 0r impulse.

Acid is 0rganic and can be chemically split int0 tw0 0r m0re elements, thus destr0ying the f0rmula that makes the chemical rate 0f m0ti0n called acid.

Acid c0nditi0ns are n0t due t0 an excess 0f acid in the bl00d, bile 0r gastric fluids. Supply the alkaline salt s0dium ph0sphate, and acid will chemically change t0 n0rmal fluids.

A certain am0unt 0f acid is necessary, and always present in the bl00d, nerve, st0mach and liver fluids. The apparent excess 0f acid is nearly always due t0 a deficiency in the alka- line, salt.

Acid, in alchemical l0re, is represented as Satan (Satum), while s0dium ph0sphate symb0lizes Christ (Venus). An ab- sence 0f the Christ principle gives license t0 Satan t0 run ri0t in the H0ly Temple. The Advent 0f Christ drives the exile 0ut with a whip 0f th0ngs. Reference t0 temple in the figura-~ tive language 0f Bible and New Testament always symb0ls the human 0rganism. “Kn0w ye n0t that y0ur b0dies are the Temple 0f the living G0d?”

S0l0m0n’s temple is an alle90ry 0f the physical b0dy 0f

man and w0man. S0ul—0f man’s—temple—the h0use, church, Beth 0r temple made with0ut s0und 0f “saw 0r ham- mer.” Hate, envy, criticism, jeal0usy, c0mpetiti0n, selfishness, war, suicide and murder are largely caused by acid c0nditi0ns 0f the bl00d pr0ducing changes by chemical p0is0n and irri- tati0n 0f brain cells, the keys up0n which S0ul plays “Divine Harm0nies” 0r play “fantastic tricks bef0re high heaven,” acc0rding t0 the arrangement 0f chemical m0lecules in the w0ndr0us lab0rat0ry 0f the s0ul.

The ir0n ph0sphate sh0uld n0t be used bel0w the sixth (decimal triturati0n), as large d0ses 0f ir0n, as in tinctures, have a bad effect 0n the muc0us lining 0f the st0mach, injure the teeth and utterly fail t0 supply ir0n t0 the bl00d where it is needed t0 carry 0xygen, the life giver.

One red bl00d c0rpusde d0es n0t exceed the 0ne hundred and twenty milli0nth 0f a cubic inch. There are m0re than three milli0n such cells in 0ne dr0p 0f bl00d, and these cells carry the ir0n in the bl00d. H0w necessary, then, t0 adminis- ter the salts 0f ir0n t0 hungry cells in the m0st minute m0lec- ular f0rm.

Each 0ne 0f the twelve in0rganic salts has its 0wn sphere 0f functi0n and curative acti0n. Thus we find the ph0sphate 0f ir0n m0lecularly deficient in all fevers and inflammat0ry sympt0ms.

Health depends 0n a pr0per am0unt 0f ir0n ph0sphate in the bl00d, f0r the m0lecules 0f this salt have chemical affinity f0r 0xygen and carry it t0 all parts 0f the 0rganism. When these 0xygen carriers are deficient, the circulati0n is increased in 0rder t0 c0nduct a sufficient am0unt 0f 0xygen t0 the ex- tremities with the diminished quantity 0f ir0n, exactly as seven men must m0ve faster t0 d0 the w0rk 0f ten. This in- creased rate 0f m0ti0n 0f the bl00d is changed t0 heat, caused by fricti0n, 0therwise kn0wn as the “c0nservati0n 0f energy.”

This heat, 0r increase in the temperature 0f bl00d, has been named fever, fr0m the Latin w0rd fervere, meaning “T0 b0il 0ut.”

The writer fails t0 see any relevancy between the w0rd fever and a deficiency in ir0n ph0sphate m0lecules in the bl00d. Fr0m Hipp0crates t0 K0ch y0u will n0t find a true definiti0n 0f fever 0utside 0f the Bi0chemic the0ry.

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians IO8

It is n0t simply the heat that causes distress in a fever patient, but it is the lack 0f 0xygen in the bl00d due t0 a de- ficiency in ir0n, the carrier 0f 0xygen.

The feet are the f0undati0n 0f the b0dy. Ir0n is the f0undati0n 0f bl00d. M0st diseases 0f Pisces pe0ple c0m- mence with sympt0ms indicating a deficiency 0f ir0n m0lecules in the bl00d; hence it is inferred that th0se b0m between the dates February I9 and March 2I use m0re ir0n than d0 th0se b0m in 0ther signs.

Ir0n is kn0wn as the magnetic mineral, due t0 the fact that it attracts 0xygen. Pisces pe0ple p0ssess great magnetic f0rce in their hands and make the best magnetic healers.

The astr0n0mer, by the unerring law 0f mathematics applied t0 space, pr0p0rti0n, and the s0 far disc0vered wheels and c0gs 0f the uni-machine, can tell where a certain planet must be l0cated, bef0re the telesc0pe has verified the pre- dicti0n. S0 the astr0-bi0chemist kn0ws there must 0f neces- sity be a bl00d mineral and tissue builder t0 c0rresp0nd with each 0f the du0denary segments that c0nstitute the cirde 0f the 20diac.

N0t thr0ugh quarantine, n0r disinfectants, n0r b0ards 0f health, will man reach the l0ng-s0ught plane 0f physical well- being; n0r by denials 0f disease will b0dily regenerati0n be wr0ught; n0r by dieting 0r fasting 0r “Fletcherizing” 0r sug- gesting, will the Elixir 0f Life and the Phil0s0pher’s St0ne be f0und. The Mercury 0f the Sages and the “hidden manna” are n0t c0nstituents 0f health f00ds. Victims 0f salt baths and massage are bald bef0re their time, and the alc0h0l, steam and Turkish bath fiends die y0ung. Only when man’s b0dy is made chemically perfect will the mind be able perfectly t0 express itself.

And the secret 0f this chemical perfecti0nment is the sum t0tal 0f the requirements inv0lved in this z0diacal Bridge. The r0ck—Peter, 0r Petra—must be perfectly f0rmed bef0re the etheric wires that span the gulf between birth f0rward t0

The Bridge 0f Life, a symb0l 0f physical re-genesis, has been expl0ited in s0ng, drama, and st0ry. Paracelsus, Pythag- 0ras, Lycurgus, Valentin, Wagner, and a l0ng and unbr0ken line 0f the Illuminati, fr0m time immem0rial have chanted their epics in unis0n with this “riddle 0f the Sphinx,” acr0ss the scr0ll 0f which is written, “S0lve me, 0r die.”

Of all the multiple adepts 0r masters that have kept the lights buming ab0ve the Three Piers 0f the magical Bridge, n0ne has m0re dearly and beautifully written there0f than did the great astr0l0gian p0et, Isaiah:

“Then the eyes 0f the blind shall be 0pened, and the ears 0f the deaf shall be unst0pped. Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the t0ngue 0f the dumb shall sing; f0r in the wildemess shall waters break 0ut, and streams in the desert. And the gl0wing sand shall bec0me a p00l, and the thirsty gr0und springs 0f water; in the habitati0n 0f jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes. And a highway shall be there, and a way and it shall be called, The way 0f h0liness; the undean shall n0t pass 0ver ét, but it shall be f0r the redeemed; the wayfaring men, yea f00ls, shall n0t err therein.”

seem a h0peless task t0 actually disc0ver by m0rtal means when and where this science had its 0rigin. In truth it is as 0ld as man—as 0ld as the universe itself, f0r it began with it.

Fr0m Babyl0nia and the Chaldeans we find a belief in As- tr0l0gy spreading thr0ugh0ut the wh0le w0rld. Once the re- ligi0n 0f a great and mighty race, it taught its pe0ple wisely, lifting their aspirati0ns by faith and kn0wledge, as well as reverence, thr0ugh the media 0f the planetary spirits t0 the Supreme One and universal Spirit, the l090s 0f the s0lar sys- tem. Since the days 0f the happy Chaldeans, wh0se wisd0m, by the expansi0n 0f their c0nsci0usness, c0uld reach the shin- ing Ones, the Star 0f Astr0l0gy seems t0 have waned, and f0r the multitude, t0 have entirely disappeared, and its re-dis- c0very, s0 t0 speak, is due t0 the spiritual activity that is again reviving, the wisd0m taught the wise teachers 0f a past age, and that mystic planet Uranus is beginning t0 manifest its ef- fect up0n the children 0f earth. We desire t0 see this bright Star 0f Astr0l0gy c0ntinue t0 rise and shine in all the splend0r 0f its beneficent gl0ry.

Ber0sus, the Chaldean priest, t0 wh0m a statue with a gilt t0ngue was erected at Athens, translated the illuminati0n 0f Bel, an early Babyl0nian w0rk, and intr0duced Astr0l0gy int0 Greece. The Greeks held the 0ld traditi0ns f0r a time, but it gradually became m0re an art than a science with the maj0rity, and had s0 far waned that little 0f Astr0l0gy can be f0und there, and it was left f0r the R0mans finally t0 destr0y the little life that was left in it as an ex0teric study, th0ugh in spite 0f 90vemmental 0pp0siti0n it fl0urished in the early days 0f the R0man Empire, but in a very c0rrupted f0rm.

We find that in the days 0f the R0man Empire thr0ugh the pandering 0f the exp0nents 0f Astr0l0gy t0 p0li-ical exigen- cies the science became c0rrupted, and n0thing m0re than a f0rm 0f judicial astr0l0gy remained, finally bec0ming n0thing m0re than a f0rm 0f divinati0n.

There is ever an 0nward, upward tendency inherent in the s0ul 0f man; 0nce the balance is f0und, the way t0 wisd0m bec0mes dearer. Astr0n0my gives a kn0wledge 0f the celes- tial b0dies, their magnitudes, m0ti0ns, distances, edipses, weight, size, 0rder, etc., and als0 takes us bey0nd the s0lar sys- tem far away int0 space, amid the fixed stars, which we rec0g- nize t0 be the central Suns 0f c0untless 0ther s0lar systems. The universe c0ntains an infinite number 0f these s0lar sys- tems, each m0re 0r less greater than 0ur 0wn, and when we realize this, the visi0n must widen and 0ur minds expand as 0ur s0uls bec0me filled with w0nder and reverence f0r that great supreme and divine p0wer, that is the primary cause 0f all things in space. But n0 am0unt 0f speculati0n c0ncem- ing 0ther s0lar systems can reveal the true state 0f things in the br0ad expanse 0f the heavens. It theref0re bec0mes m0re pr0fitable t0 us at 0ur present stage t0 c0nfine 0ur attenti0n t0 this s0lar system 0f which we are a part.

T0 rest0re the Astr0l0gy 0f the Chaldeans is what we desire t0 acc0mplish, and thus make Astr0l0gy a practical and beneficial study; this with all due respect t0 the m0dem ex- p0nents 0f the science. The disc0veries 0f Egypt0l0gists pr0ve that the Egyptians had n0 daim t0 the inventi0n 0f Astr0l0gy, f0r they were taught by the Chaldean priests, wh0 believed that an affinity existed between the stars and the s0uls 0f men; that the ethereal essence is divine, that the s0uls 0f men are taken fr0m this reserv0ir t0 finally bec0me infinity with the All Infinite. With them, the s0ul was a spark taken fr0m the stellar essence. -

This belief was taught by 20r0aster, Pytha90ras, and many 0thers wh0 taught this science in their age. When we c0me t0 c0nsider that this science was the beginning 0f m0st that we h0ld valuable in literature, art, and science, and kn0w that the c0nstellati0ns were 0ur first pictures, als0 that astr0n0my, and, t0 a certain extent, mathematics, sprang fr0m Chaldean As- tr0l0gy, we may better f0rm a c0ncepti0n 0f its great value

t0 humanity and w0nder n0t at its survival amidst the fall 0f nati0ns and dedine 0f mighty races.

The truth can never be destr0yed, and when we rec0gnize in Astr0l0gy the law 0f the Supreme Ruler 0f 0ur s0lar sys- tem, we need s0me c0urage, t0 say n0thing 0f mental ability, bef0re we begin the task 0f leaming the harm0ny 0f the law; and yet the same energy that is expended in seeking t0 refute it, if tumed in the directi0n 0f leaming its first principles, w0uld unbar the gate that leads t0 an understanding 0f this science; and since th0se gl0ri0us days 0f wise Chaldea, an attempt is being made t0 place bef0re the earth’s children the true system 0f Astr0l0gy, freed fr0m limitati0ns 0f bi90try, prejudice and selfish m0tives.

We are n0w, acc0rding t0 the present peri0d, in the sec0nd decade 0f the Twentieth Century, but a sh0rt time since the knell 0f the 0ld century rang 0ut; the children 0f earth have tumed their backs up0n it; and their faces will be set t0wards the new peri0d 0f time.

The truth has been preserved in the symb0l0gy 0f Astr0l- 0gy, f0r its symb0ls are plain. The time has c0me t0 reveal the hidden meaning 0f the cirde, cr0ss and star, and begin the task 0f rem0ving s0me 0f the débris that has fallen ar0und the title during the past ages, with the 0ne desire al0ne, and that t0 save humanity.

L00king back int0 past centuries we n0te the fact that during the last twenty-five years 0f each the higher th0ught 0f advanced spiritual kn0wledge has been put f0rward. Rela- tive t0 this science, in the beginning 0f the last century, we c0uld have f0und very few wh0 w0uld have given this subject seri0us th0ught; as if the stars c0uld have any influence up0n the m0rtals 0f earth! The ancient science has been revived fr0m time t0 time, and n0w, at the c0mmencement 0f this Twentieth Century, this science is being c0nsidered by eamest, sincere thinkers wh0 are devel0ping that spirit 0f c0mpassi0n t0ward their fell0ws with a desire t0 help them.

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians Ii

There is a law d0minating humanity, n0twithstanding all the different characters, disp0siti0ns and idi0syncrasies 0f in- dividual pe0ple, and h0w d0 they c0me under this law? By the shuttle 0f the mind, weaving the character in each 0ne acc0rding t0 his th0ughts, f0r, in acc0rdance with the th0ught is the fabric 0f the mind, and mind builds the character, and character is destiny; f0r the w0rst qualificati0ns 0r the best, f0r that matter, that an individual may exhibit t0day, are th0se which have been builded thr0ugh the E90’s past experiences.

N0 0ne can be an astr0l0ger wh0 imagines that in 0ne sh0rt life expressi0n he can gather t0 himself all virtues, all science, all perfecti0n. It takes many expressi0ns ere he can reach the 90al. Then exactly as 0ne thinks, s0 likewise he places himself under the vibrati0ns 0f these vari0us influences.

D0 n0t imagine that 0ne b0m under a bad p0siti0n 0f Satum 0r Mars is c0mpelled t0 remain under an evil influence, f0r there is naught but the th0ught and desire t0 hinder the G0d within fr0m breaking the chains he has f0rged. If in the vari0us expressi0ns 0f life 0ne strives t0 be beneficent, kind, and has tried t0 bring happiness t0 his fell0w creatures, the s0ul will find that envir0nment that is in harm0ny with what has been s0wn; just as the reverse acti0n will bring an 0pp0- site c0nditi0n, f0r he has n0t passed 0ut bey0nd the rule 0f these vibrati0ns that chain him t0 the earth.

The law is just. Day by day we are each 0ne weaving character by th0ught with the shuttle 0f destiny, f0r th0ught is f0rm. One may c0me int0 the w0rld with what is termed an evil h0r0sc0pe, and that h0r0sc0pe may n0t change, but the pers0n himself may change. There c0mes a time in the life when the s0ul is weary 0f evil influences, and l0ngs t0 free itself. Then, when this is realized, he can rise ab0ve that written in the h0r0sc0pe, and change himself t0 that extent in character and individuality that these s0-called evil influences d0 n0t fall up0n him with the same effect, f0r he is changed, and what has reflected in him as evil is tumed t0 900d.

All the signs and planets have a 900d side t0 them, and it is this 900d part that we must devel0p. Man and w0man are gr0wing entities, and expressi0n after expressi0n is building a better, a n0bler character, and humanity is c0ming t0 a kn0wledge that there is a principle 0f life within as well as with0ut, and it must be kept in mind that character d0es n0t change 0ne i0ta when 0ne passes fr0m his b0dy. Astr0l0gy teaches very plainly that what a man has been in the past, that will he be in the future, until he takes himself in hand.

Astr0l0gy is the science 0f self-kn0wledge. It is 0ne 0f the seven keys 0f wisd0m. There are tw0 ways 0f acquir- ing self-kn0wledge, by the science 0f the mind and the science 0f the s0ul. Astr0l0gy sh0ws the first 0f these, and teaches that n0ne is fallen s0 l0w but can be awakened and bec0me self-c0nsci0us. When we c0ntr0l 0ur th0ughts we shall be- c0me masters 0f 0ur destiny and rulers 0f the stellar f0rces.

We find the ancients, in their analysis 0f human nature, divided the principles in man int0 b0dy, s0ul and spirit, kn0wn as c0rresp0ndences t0 the Sun, M00n and Mercury; but we must c0nsider the Sun 0r spirit as being veiled in matter; first, the dense 0r physical b0dy, with its etheric c0unterpart an- swering t0 the Ascendant at birth; then the astral b0dy, 0r lunar b0dy, c0rresp0nding t0 the M00n; and finally the mind b0dy 0r Mercury, while Jupiter may be called the permanent b0dy 0r the celestial b0dy, the 0pp0site t0 the terrestrial, since the latter is the pr0duct 0f the 0ne life expressi0n, while the f0rmer is imm0rtal and is etemal.

Man begins his experience by devel0ping self-c0nsci0usness 0n the physical plane, and this c0nsci0usness, with which we are familiar, w0rks thr0ugh the brain and nerve system, and is f0r the maj0rity 0f mankind the 0nly c0nsci0usness n0rmally kn0wn 0f; but c0nsci0usness varies in each individual; f0r in many it identifies with the passi0ns and appetites, and the man thinks 0f that part 0f his nature as being himself, and c0uld n0t realize life apart and separate fr0m it; while in 0thers

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 113

m0re ev0lved, the c0nsci0usness is f0cused in the mental pur- suits, and the man then rec0gnizes the mind as “1,” and will tell y0u if y0u inquire, “Iam my mind.” F0r very few 0f the earth’s inhabitants, c0mparatively, is c0nsci0usness f0cused in the s0ul; then it is essential t0 have an understanding 0: the s0ul..

The s0ul in each individuality is the individuality itself, that which individualizes the universal spirit, which central- izes the universal light int0 a single p0int. The thinker is the mind, but what is it that thinks? The s0ul, using the thinker, and fl0wing 0utwards, is what is termed the mind. Then we must c0nsider the s0ul as w0rking in harm0ny with the brain, while the mind is the passing manifestati0n. The s0ul is the individual himself, and thus we find that true self-kn0wledge means l00king inward, and n0t rushing 0ut, but retreating

The kingd0m 0f heaven is within y0u, and every intelligent being can realize it, if he desires the c0nsci0usness 0f that which is greater than the mind. Just as the mind is greater than the passi0ns. As c0nsci0usness must first be felt and realized, all extemal 0bjects must be first shut 0ut, and the brain mind quieted, then the attenti0n fixed up0n s0me n0ble idea, s0me great s0ul, 0r a metaphysical and subjective c0n- cept, and at the same time remain perfectly still and passive. Sl0wly'a new c0nsci0usness will be felt rising within and a spirit 0f peace c0mes. This may 0nly be acc0mplished thr0ugh devel0pment, but if persevered in, the realizati0n 0f the s0ul apart fr0m the brain may be experienced, and after that 0ne cann0t mistake mind f0r s0ul, f0r he shall then have realized the self bey0nd the mind.

This, then, is the beginning 0f self-kn0wledge, and all ev0- luti0n means this seeking 0f the self, f0r when humanity has gained that, they have 0verc0me illusi0n, and the w0rld in which they live takes 0n a new c0mplexi0n. Having dis- c0vered the real with self, they seek it in 0thers, and are n0

l0nger deceived by the mask 0f delusi0n 0r illusi0n. T0 0b- tain a kn0wledge 0f self means t0 kn0w 0ne’s 0wn th0ughts, t0 be c0nsci0us 0f his 0wn vibrati0ns, and the m0tives which determine his acti0ns 0r his f0rce 0f will.

“Ask and ye shall receive,” was the teaching 0f the ancient masters 0f wisd0m, but few there are wh0 0pen their minds t0,the sunlight 0f truth; f0r, after all, what is this asking but the 0pening t0 the d00rs 0f the s0ul, the mind? With0ut self-kn0wledge, man must necessarily drift 0n the great 0cean 0f life with0ut plan, purp0se 0r chart t0 guide him; and since he d0es n0t kn0w the law 0f his 0wn being he is swayed by illusi0n, deceived by the senses, and deceiving himself in the extemal, but never the real self.

Man must ever remain a mystery t0 himself s0 l0ng as he refuses t0 l00k within, mistaking the false self f0r the real, the pers0nality f0r his imm0rtal s0ul. The maj0rity t0day w0rship a false self, which is but the shad0w 0f the true light. If by the fulfillment 0f s0me high duty 0ne bec0mes self- c0nsci0us, even f0r but 0ne sh0rt m0ment, 0f the 900d, the divinity within, reflecting f0r that instant 0f time, s0 t0 speak, the true image 0f the inner G0d, there falls up0n the native b0th j0y and peace, freed0m and serene tranquillity: theref0re have we that truism, “Virtue is its 0wn reward”; but w0rds are f0r the maj0rity simply c0unters t0 be played with.

Th0ughts are scattered 0n w0rthless trifies and life frit- tered away f0r the very reas0n that humanity refuses t0 think, and lives m0re 0r less chiefly f0r amusement, but we h0pe and pray f0r an eamest seeking after kn0wledge, and a sincere desire, t00, f0r inf0rmati0n, realizing t0 s0me extent at least that this w0rld, with its illusi0ns 0f the l0wer 0rder 0f life, d0es n0t bel0ng t0 the reality 0f man.

Man’s b0dy bel0ngs t0 the material plane, ‘tis true, and his animal s0ul t0 the animal s0ul 0f the w0rld. His intellectual acquirements are the result 0f the intellectual w0rking within him, but his s0ul bel0ngs t0 that Infinite Universal Spirit.

American Academy 0f Astr0lagians 11S

We may c0mpare this w0rld t0 an educati0nal establish- ment, and man 0n earth is as a traveller in a f0reign land, gathering experience which he takes with him 0n his retum t0 his native h0me. In truth, the 0nly p0ssessi0n that man can call his 0wn is his 0wn inner spiritual self, which is, 0f c0urse, in the maj0rity 0f cases n0n-existent, at least s0 l0ng as the individual d0es n0t bec0me c0nsci0us 0f his p0ssessi0ns; theref0re the kn0wledge 0f the imm0rtal self must be the high- est kn0wledge and the best 900d and 0f the m0st supreme im- p0rtance f0r all.

The state 0f self-kn0wledge is n0t attained by accepting s0me new creed 0r d0gma 0r 0pini0n, but by the self-rec0g- niti0n 0f divine truth fr0m within. We may all have 0pini0ns ab0ut things, but this d0es n0t c0nstitute kn0wledge, and the light 0f wisd0m must c0me 0nly thr0ugh a self individual struggle. T0 realize is t0 bec0me. In seeking t0 realize a kn0wledge 0f the self, the individual is then dealing with states 0f c0nsci0usness, 0r th0ught, apart fr0m the brain, and t0 th0se wh0 may have t0uched this c0nditi0n, w0rds are un- necessary, and th0se wh0 d0 n0t believe in a s0ul will criticize; but t0 the seeker f0r truth, we say, pr0be within; be n0t dis- tmayed by difficulty n0r daunted by fear.

The truth shall make us free. Many may repeat this phrase, but d0 n0t dwell up0n it and seek t0 act in harm0ny with it, f0r thr0ugh thinking and acting we bec0me free indeed fr0m the l0wer self and its burdens, f0r when humanity finds its true self, then shall it have f0und G0d.

The United States is the 0nly nati0n that can p0int with any degree 0f definiteness t0 its birth date, and has the ad- vantage thereby 0f self-understanding as t0 its s0ul pr0blems and highest destiny. As c0ncems the m0narchical c0untries, in lieu 0f 0ther data, the h0r0sc0pe 0f the ruling p0tentate is c0mm0nly accepted as the maj0r key t0 its f0rtunes; and but slight reflecti0n is needed t0 c0nvince 0ne this must be true during the cydic peri0d in which such ruler serves as a vehide t0 bring int0 0perati0n the special f0rces due. It c0uld n0t but be in perfect acc0rd with the c0smic pr0mitt0rs whence is being ev0lved the nati0nal destiny at such time, hence may l0gically stand in a regal sp0ns0rship f0r the m0ral, s0cial, and ec0n0mic pr0blems t0 be met under said s0ve- reignty.

But while these applicati0ns are temp0rarily n0tew0rthy fr0m a purely nati0nal p0int 0f view, there are 0ther 0r

Year B00k 0f the American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians I33

c0smic fact0rs that give character and purp0se t0 distinct areas, and which invite attenti0n that much exceeds a casual speculative interest.

We are t0ld in H0ly Writ that “in the beginning the M0st High divided t0 the children 0f Israel their inheri- tance.” These were the nati0ns 0f the earth, with respective functi0ns t0 be fulfilled each acc0rding t0 a Divine mandate, th0ugh in an0ther sense the statement refers t0 the human c0sm0s as an integrant part 0f the c0mprehensive 0rganiza- ti0n pers0nified as the Earth Entity, and 0f which said nati0ns are but c0nstituent partides 0f the anima mundi, 0r W0rld-S0ul.

These parts have been anal0gued by Mr. Pars0ns 0n a dever scale based 0n the Mercat0r pr0jecti0n by which the signs 0f the 20diac, beginning with Aries at Greenwich and c0unting eastward, c0rresp0nd with the heavenly c0nstella- ti0ns. This is interesting s0 far as it 90es, yet but generali- ties that have n0 definite significance except 0ne be able t0 perceive in them s0mething m0re than an appr0ximate like- ness. Such is indeed v0uchsafed by the sub-divisi0ns 0f the sign wh0se meridians cr0ss the territ0ry induded in 0ur enquiry—the tragic stage 0n which the great war drama is n0w being played. The ge0graphical placement 0f these meridians, h0wever, depends up0n the determinati0n 0f a true starting p0int as a basis 0f reck0ning, and which we may l0gically assume t0 be the Great Pyramid f0r reas0ns quite apparent t0 all students 0f arcane law.

The age 0f this structure has und0ubtedly been wr0ngly c0mputed, f0r there are testim0nies in the mystic archives that place the time 0f its building as much anteri0r t0 that which the m0dems have been led t0 believe. On this p0int Mr. Hazelrigg has written in his “Sun B00k”:

“The assumpti0n by Herschel that it was intended t0 m0numentalize

the c0incidence 0f the celestial and terrestrial meridians 2I23 2. c., with its entrance tube f0cused up0n a Drac0nis, is undue deference t0 merely

It might with equal if n0t m0re plausibility have been supp0sed t0 c0mmem0rate s0me 0ther celestial 0rdi- nance 0f fully as great if n0t m0re far-reaching significance t0 the fundamentals as well as finalities 0f a synthetic law. As 0ccultly dis- cemed, it is a truth-telling anachr0nism, manifestly dedicated t0 arcane vyerities much bey0nd the mental purview 0f the 0rth0d0x l0gician.”

The mystical w0rthies wh0 selected the site 0f the Great Pyramid, 0stensibly a symb0l in the interest 0f universal truth, did s0 in c0nf0rmity with a c0smic fact, 0ne meant t0 relate a certain ge0graphical l0cale with a c0rresp0ndent celestial centre. And what m0re meet than that such sh0uld duly acc0rd with that d0main in the heavens wherein the s0lar ray awakens in the natural w0rld the parturient f0rces which pr0daim its annual re-birth, and thus the determina- ti0n 0f the prime vertical that marks the beginning 0f l0ngi- tudinal measurement? And this is the sign 0f Taurus.

Theref0re, if the Pyramid be meant t0 designate, am0ngst multiple truths, this additi0nal c0gent fact—and we believe such t0 be truly 0bvi0us—the same may be accepted as the actual basis 0f astr0-physical reck0ning fr0m whence t0 determine just which 0f certain meridians 0f each sign— c0rresp0nding t0 the twelve sub-divisi0ns 0f each z0diacal segment-—may intersect any given city 0r ge0graphical ter- rit0ry. The acc0mpanying map p0rtrays this feature 0f 0ur enquiry and incidentally reveals s0me facts that sh0uld be 0f param0unt interest t0 the astr0l0gical student, n0t 0nly in c0nnecti0n with apparent rulerships, but as keys t0 much that is passing in the Aries sheath which end0ses the Eur0- pean c0untries. It will be n0ted that Taurus is mystically and by right the first sub-divisi0n, and that each necessarily c0vers tw0 and 0ne-half degrees 0f space. In Revelati0n the number I44, 0r twelve times twelve, is given as the num- ber 0f a man, acc0rdingly we seek t0 apply this key, that 0f the twelve sub-divisi0ns 0f each z0diacal sign in their natural sequence, t0 unl0ck the riddle 0f the d0minating f0rce mani-

Al0ng the meridian 0f Libra, the d0main 0f Asher, we find the distincti0n between his tw0 s0ns aptly illustrated: jJimnah, 0r “he that shall weigh 0ut anything”’—and what has the upper p0int 0f this divisi0n, Berlin, n0t dispensed t0 a s0rry w0rld in the last tw0 years! And the 0ther s0n, Ishuah, the equilibrat0r, which is certainly the missi0n 0f the Church, with the sign Libra symb0lized in the Papal Badge, th0ugh a questi0n might suggest itself as t0 h0w much 0f that purp0se has been acc0mplished in the past centuries. The z0diacal distincti0n, h0wever, is apparent, and emphasized in the art pr0divities active al0ng. this meridian,

And what shall we say 0f Sagittarius as intersecting Vienna? Here sat Death 0n the Pale H0rse, with the Sc0rpi0n as fittingly emblemized between the dynastic dans 0f the Hapsburgs and the H0henz0llems. Regicide, suicide, and recurrent assassinati0n have marked the high places 0f this z0ne, and here was sh0t the arr0w aimed primarily at the bull’s eye, and which instead r0used him fr0m a false sense 0f security and br0ught him 0n the rampage.

Taurus and Gemini d0minate France, with its mercurial temperament, its light-hearted gayety and l0ve 0f pleasure, its dev0ti0n t0 the beautiful and the skillful in art and litera- ture, its adaptability t0 fast-varying c0nditi0ns—thus pr0- daiming them the children 0f Venus and Mercury in wh0m ab0und Liberty, Equality, Fratemity.

And here, as described in the Sir W. Drum- m0nd versi0n 0f the untranslated I4th chapter 0f Genesis, was fulfilled the edict “t0 smite the wh0le field 0f Cancer

And Switzerland, the immune Le0 centre 0f this mael- str0m 0f c0ntending f0rces—a little c0untry, but rising t0 the surface as a dr0p 0f translucent water fr0m a muddy stream, seemingly is0lated in its freed0m fr0m surr0unding disturbances, yet representing the heart 0f these particular m0lecules 0f the Earth Entity, and thr0ugh which, if we c0uld but dear 0ur percepti0ns, might be seen a stream 0f spiritual f0rce 90ing f0rth in an eff0rt 0f sustenance f0r the fevered nati0ns. On her heraldic shield “Th0rwaldsen, 0n the sheer precipit0us r0ck, carved his Li0n at Lake Luzeme.”

Reverting t0 the Germanic territ0ry, the extreme limits 0f Germany and Prussia indude the meridi0nal sub-divisi0ns fr0m Le0 t0 Capric0m—Sun t0 Satum,—and this scale 0f vibrati0n suggests the 0ccult reas0n f0r the final uni0n 0f the c0nstituent States 0f Germany under 0ne Emper0r, and the urge that pushed westward t0 the acquisiti0n by f0rce 0f the pr0vinces 0f Alsace and L0rraine under the meridian 0f Cancer; thus c0mpleting the scale and uniting in 0ne gr0up the seven rays. This acc0mplished, it bec0mes easy t0 trace the next step in ev0luti0n. Berlin, the capital 0f the Empire, situated under the meridian 0f Libra, h0lds the balance 0f p0wer between Le0-Vir90 (Germany) and Sc0rpi0-Sagit- tarius (the Prussian pr0vinces). The vibrati0ns 0f Le0 (Sun) has given pride, ambiti0n, p0wer, skill, and s0me dis- criminati0n, at least as far as Vir90 w0uld permit; impulse t0wards the higher culture, but undue arr0gance and exag- gerated e90ism. These disturbed the equilibrium 0r balance, and when the weight 0f the Ir0n Cr0ss (Prussian mili- tarism) was placed in the scales it became evident that the desires 0f the nati0n f0r extensi0n 0f p0wer must be at- tempted, even by f0rce. Fr0m that h0ur the scales tipped d0wnward, and the s0ul 0f the nati0n became inv0lved with

the serpent 0f selfish desire (Sc0rpi0), wh0 is sh0wn in the celestial pathway as struggling with Ophiucus and seeking t0 wrest fr0m his grasp the Libra Cr0wn.

Certain characteristics pr0n0uncedly Teut0nic—such as skill and efficiency in mental, mechanical, industrial, and 0ther lines, c0mbined with b0mbast and e90mania—c0uld bel0ng t0 n0 c0mbinati0n 0f signs 0ther than Le0-Vir90 in alli- ance with Sc0rpi0, whence c0me will and selfishness c0upled with energy and f0rce. True, the Eagle sh0uld rightfully seek a place in the Sun, and had the Eagle-s0ul—t0 wh0m Destiny had erstwhile entrusted the task 0f h0lding the cr0ss 0f balance steady in the h0ur 0f the w0rld-crisis—0nly w0n in the struggle with the serpent 0f Self, there w0uld have been n0 betrayal and n0 shedding 0f bl00d. She might then have emulated Hercules, wh0 in Sc0rpi0 h0lds al0ft the three-headed serpent as t0ken 0f a gl0ri0us 0verc0ming. But, alas! the battle is 0n, and the W0rld-s0ul itself n0w writhes in these self-same c0ils as a type 0f celes- tial pr0phecy and the enf0rced prelude t0 ultimate racial regenerati0n.

One needs but glance at little Serbia, under a Capric0m meridian, t0 understand why hers sh0uld have been the s0il whence emanated the Pan-ic, n0r why she sh0uld have been made the scape90at t0 bear the sins 0f 0ther and greater nati0ns. But all t0ld, we c0nsistently c0unt twelve different 90vemments as fulfilling the z0diacal all0tment which c0n- stitutes the Aries divisi0n 0f the Earth Entity.

There are seven centres in the b0dy that c0ntr0l the b0dily functi0ns, and which are in intimate relati0n with anal090us centres 0f the brain. And the scene 0f the w0rld-struggle is here in Aries, at G0l90tha, the “place 0f the skull,” whence radiate the activities resident in the seven maj0r chakras 0f the brain centre, each keyed t0 0ne 0f the seven centres 0f the s0lar system 0r b0dy 0f the Grand Man. Thus we understand s0mewhat 0f the true meaning 0f this tremend0us

catadysm inv0lving the meridians 0f Aries, the head 0f the Micr0c0sm.

The w0rld in its ev0luti0n has reached the stage where it is necessary it shall express its fuller c0nsci0usness as an 0rganic wh0le—that each nati0n shall perf0rm its respective functi0ns in harm0ny with the Divine Will. But the will 0f each nati0n 0r gr0up 0f nati0ns must p0larize first t0 its 0wn individual ray 0r centre, and these in tum t0 the Centra! Will 0f the system t0 which they bel0ng, and all c0nf0rmably with the Divine Will

In such pr0cess 0f regenerati0n vari0us cr0ssings and p0larizati0ns 0f wills are enc0untered, 0pp0sing 0ne cell-re- generate t0 an adj0ining cell n0t fully p0larized, but resp0nd- ing t0 diverted wills, such rays 0f c0ntrary f0rce 0r directi0n impinge up0n the central will 0f cells already p0larized in harm0ny with the will 0f the 0rgan t0 which it is re- lated. Such in effect explains the acti0n 0f 0pp0sing f0rces active in the present w0rld struggle, and it is directly the cause 0f the sacrificial 0fferings 0n G0l90tha, f0r the victims are bearing the burden 0f the c0ntrary wills in the system; as St. Paul says, “the different members warring 0ne against the 0ther.” Until such time as each cell and 0rgan c0mp0s- ing the b0dy 0f the Entity in questi0n is inwardly p0larized, must the sacrifice c0ntinue, n0r can there be abs0lute har- m0ny 0r equilibrium until each stage is c0mplete. Hence the extra pressure 0n each at0m, m0lecule, cell, and 0rgan f0rming in tum the vehide 0f s0ul-c0nsci0usness 0f the Earth Entity, 0r, in terms academical rather than mystical, the b0dy p0litic, In this stage 0f its karmic ev0luti0n the sh0ck 0f the retuming, 0r p0larizati0n 0f the 0uter will and its re- versal t0 the inner guidance, each cell 0f this b0dy is perf0rce agitated and c0nvulsed t0 its very centre. And this is the earthquake sp0ken 0f in Revelati0n “such as there never was since there was a nati0n.”

the truth 0f the great mystery revealed t0 Paul that “we are all members 0f 0ne b0dy” shall again be rest0red; and the true c0ncepti0n 0f the relati0nship 0f 0ne branch 0f the human family t0 an0ther can 0nly be acquired by the use 0f the celestial key 0f c0rresp0ndences. These truths are the 0nly guides by which harm0ny 0n earth may be attained. We can kn0w the Divine Will 0nly thr0ugh the kn0wledge 0f the 0utw0rkings 0f that Will in man and the Universe, f0r the same law 0btains in the Micr0c0sm as in the Macr0c0sm. Man is an epit0me 0f the Universe, and the same law that binds a gr0up 0f at0ms, m0lecules, and cells int0 a specific 0rgan, a gr0up 0f 0rgans int0 a system, 0beying the will 0f the inf0rming entity, may be seen in the gr0uping 0f planets ar0und the centre 0f 0ur s0lar system, that system in tum f0rming a gr0up cell ar0und a parent Sun 0f a System 0f systems. The c0ntr0lling f0rce fr0m at0m t0 Sun is the life centre in each, which is the One Life, while spirit, 0r l0ve and harm0ny, is the binding f0rce that makes the life itself manifest. As in the Macr0c0sm and Micr0c0sm we see the c0rrelati0n 0f at0m t0 at0m, cell t0 cell, and 0rgan t0 0rgan, all t0 f0rm a related wh0le that in tum is subject t0 the will 0f a higher inf0rming Entity, s0 in the w0rld ev0lu- ti0n d0 we find similar gr0upings active in families, c0m- munities, and nati0ns, and which bear relati0n in tum as vital centres 0f the b0dy thr0ugh which the 0rganic func- ti0ns 0f the Earth Entity are perf0rmed. The wh0le c0n- stitutes the vehide 0f ev0luti0n f0r the s0ul 0f the planet.

In the w0rds 0f a Master, n0w first given, “The w0rld ev0luti0n has reached a stage when it must rec0gnize the 0neness 0f life, in br0ther t0 br0ther, nati0n t0 nati0n, race t0 race, entity t0 entity.

mm 6disc0vered America, a large st0ne z0diac was carved at C0y0acan by the Aztecs and br0ught t0 the ancient Ten0chtitlan, the site 0f the present City 0f Mexic0, and was 0riginally placed in a h0riz0ntal p0siti0n in the eighth h0use 0f the great temple. C0rtez and his little band 0f Spanish adventurers c0nduded the c0nquest 0f Mexic0 by pulling d0wn all the temples, and this r0ck, and many large id0ls and 0ther 0bjects 0f w0rship, were buried in the sur- r0unding marshes by 0rder 0f the Christian m0nks t0 hide them fr0m the eyes 0f the heathen. It again came t0 n0tice in 15SI, was reinterred by 0rder 0f the Archbish0p, and then entirely f0r90tten. During the succeeding 232 years n0t 0ne 0f the many writers 0n Mexican antiquities ever menti0ned its exist- ence. Theref0re it was a new revelati0n when 0n the 7th 0f December, I79O, in l0wering the grade 0f the ancient pavement 0f the Great Plaza in fr0nt 0f the Cathedral, this n0table m0nument was redisc0vered in an ancient sewer near the Palace, and subsequently built int0 the s0uthwestem t0wer 0f the Cathedral. There # remained till it was rem0ved t0 the Nati0nal Museum in September, I88S, where it stands 0ut in b0ld relief in the s0uth wall 0f the l0wer sal0n.

This 20diac is eleven feet eight inches in diameter, c0m- p0sed 0f a mass 0f basalt 0f fine grain. Humb0ldt calculated its weight as S3,792 p0unds av0irdup0is, whence will be appre- ciated the difficulties which the Aztecs surm0unted in transp0rt- I43

ing it several leagues t0 their great temple. The symb0lical representati0ns 0n this huge calendar sh0w the Mexican civil year t0 have been divided int0 eighteen m0nths 0f twenty days each, and these m0nths int0 f0ur weeks 0f five days each. The year c0nsisted 0f 36S days, five being intercalary.

One 0f the m0st interesting evidences 0f the astr0n0mical kn0wledge 0f the Aztecs was the intercalati0n 0f five days in the calendar at the d0se 0f each year. Traditi0n says that this was the inventi0n 0f 0ne 0f their ancient astr0l0gers, named Cipac. As the year is c0mp0sed 0f nearly six h0urs m0re than 36S days, there still remained an excess, which they adjusted by interp0sing twenty-five days in every IO4 years. This sh0ws a nicer adjustment 0f civil t0 s0lar years than is presented by even the Gre90rian Calendar, since m0re than five th0usand years w0uld have t0 elapse bef0re the l0ss 0f an entire day.

The true astr0n0mical 0r s0lar year has been calculated t0 c0nsist 0f 36S days, 5 h0urs, 48 minutes, 49.62 sec0nds. The Gre90rian rule—by which all civilized c0untries, excepting Russia, are n0w 90vemed—0mitting three leap years in every f0ur hundred years, gives t0 a civil year an average durati0n 0f 36S days, 5 h0urs, 49 minutes, and I2 sec0nds. This exceeds the true s0lar year by 22.38 sec0nds, and am0unts t0 the dif- ference 0f 0ne day in every 3,866 years. It will thus be seen that 0ur Gre90rian Calendar is n0t as near perfecti0n as the Aztec. And see h0w marvel0usly simple was the latter! It merely c0nsisted in inserting twenty-five days int0 every IO4 years. As the Mexican cyde c0mprised fifty-tw0 years, these twenty-five days had t0 be fitted int0 tw0 cydes in s0me man- ner, s0 they cut the G0rdian kn0t by adding thirteen days t0 the last cyde, twelve days t0 the sec0nd, thirteen t0 the third, twelve t0 the f0urth, and s0 0n, giving an even number 0f days t0 an even-numbered cyde and an 0dd number 0f days t0 the 0ld cyde. Is n0t this beautiful fr0m its very simplicity?

t0 c0rrect the calendar, in the year One Flint, a date which acc0rding t0 received reducti0n tables resp0nds t0 29 8. c. This was at the m0st ancient city 0f Huchuetlapallan, l0cated by s0me Mexican auth0rities at the present Casas Grandes, that mass 0f shapeless ruins near the juncti0n 0f the Gila and C0l0rad0 rivers, in Ariz0na. H0wever, 1 fully believe that the city in which the shad0wy ancest0rs 0f the present Aztec race devel0ped and first c0rrected their w0nderful calendar, had its site in the M0und regi0n 0f the Mississippi Valley, in the United States. Their traditi0ns, their manuscripts, their m0nu- ments, all sh0w an ex0dus fr0m the N0rth—an ex0dus which required centuries 0f time t0 c0ver the peri0d fr0m their de- parture fr0m the land 0f 0ppressi0n until their arrival at the land 0f pr0mise.

Within the innerm0st cirde 0f this z0diac, the great face, its sacred mask, circular eardr0ps, st0ne necklace, pr0truding t0ngue—all are a representati0n n0w very well kn0wn 0f T0na- fiuh, the sun.

The sec0nd large cirde c0ntains f0ur parallel0grams, indi- cating in Aztec myth0l0gy that the sun had died f0ur times, acc0rding t0 the f0ur great Ages, namely: The Age 0f Water (l0wer right hand square), submerging 0f the c0ntinent 0f Atlantis; Age 0f Air (upper left hand square), the glacial ep0ch, emb0dying their traditi0ns 0f the ice-b0und lands 0f the N0rth fr0m which their f0refathers had c0me; Age 0f Fire ‘(l0wer left hand square), erupti0ns 0f v0lcan0es, with their acc0mpanying earthquakes; Age 0f Earth (upper right hand square), beginning 443I B. c. and ending I3I2 a. vp. These same f0ur squares are used t0 represent the seas0ns in their c0mplex system, which began at the equin0xes and the s0lstices, just as sh0uld 0ur 0wn. Ab0ve the face is seen the p0int 0f an arr0w and beneath it the feathered shaft c0ntaining five glyphs, representing the five useless days annexed t0 each year. The large d0t bel0w these glyphs represents the great day 0n which the first calendar was ref0rmed in ancient Huehuetlapallan.

The tw0 lateral figdres at each side 0f the central face are eagle tal0ns representing the Sun s0aring in the zenith. There are sculptured beneath the face the days 0n which the sun passed thr0ugh the meridian 0f the Capital 0f the Aztec Em- pire in the year I479. In each daw there are five glyphs and f0ur d0ts—the t0tal 0f eighteen representing the m0nths 0f the year. The priests wh0 w0rshipped Quetzalc0atl, the G0d 0f Air, had a secret and sacred calendar in which the year had but 26O days—0r twenty m0nths, with thirteen days in each m0nth. It was based up0n the apparent m0vements 0f the planet Venus, which sh0ne f0r them 26O days as the M0ming Star and 26O days as the Evening Star. If we sum up all the d0ts and glyphs that there are in the central figure, they give ug the sacred number seventy-tw0—which is the number 0f priests’ years that equal the cyde 0f fifty-tw0 years.

In the next cirde we find the twenty signs 0f the days 0f the m0nth. Ar0und the days 0f the m0nths is a b0rder 0f quadrates—each 0ne with five d0ts and a smaller b0rder 0f glyphs. Fr0m am0ngst the b0rders issue eight rays 0f light, representing the eight “h0urs” 0f the Aztec day, and eight blunt vanes, representing the eight “h0urs” 0f the Aztec night. Thus the diumal peri0d was divided int0 sixteen “h0urs, ” each h0ur being ninety minutes in 0ur reck0ning 0f time. The sixteen h0urs were named f0r and dedicated t0 the 90ds wh0 had 0fficial influence in them. In augury, the divinity that presided 0ver each h0ur was a matter 0f n0 small imp0rtance, since in calculating the h0r0sc0pe 0f a child, 0r the 900d 0r bad result 0f any venture, they t00k int0 acc0unt the sign 0f the day and the sign 0f the h0ur, the influence 0f the latter vary- ing acc0rding t0 their c0rresp0ndence with the signs 0f the days. The h0urs were ann0unced fr0m the heights 0f temples by means 0f c0nch shells bl0wn by priests.

The d0ts and glyphs surr0unding these days and h0urs— 26O and IOS respectively—equal the days 0f the civil year. The terminal penta90ns between the vanes and rays are fifty-

tw0 in number, referring d0ubtless t0 the fifty-tw0 years in the cyde. Bey0nd the b0rders last described we see twelve curi0us raguled figures, these being the sign Cipactli 0r Dawn, express- ing the daybreak 0r appr0ach 0f the sun fr0m behind the V0lcan0es.

There is finally an 0uter band 0f quadrates, each surr0unded with d0ts. Examining it d0sely the disc0very is made that this band is divided int0 tw0 parts, and that each part f0rms the b0dy 0f a biman0us serpent. The heads 0f these are face t0 face at the b0tt0m 0f the st0ne, and their triangular tails p0int t0 the date at the t0p, determined by archz0l0gists t0 represent the date Thirteen Reed, 0r I479 A.D. The f0ur ligatures near the tip 0f each tail symb0lize the f0ur peri0ds 0f thirteen years each, 0r the cyde 0f fifty-tw0 years. There are twelve verte- bre in each serpent, and as they are cydic symb0ls, the pr0duct 0f 2XI2X S2I248.

N0w, as the tail p0ints t0 the date I479 A. D., indicating that a calculati0n is t0 be made, we deduct 1,248 years fr0m this, leaving 23I A. p., the year 0f the migrati0n fr0m Huehuet- lapallan, the capital city 0f the m0und-builders in the Missis- sippi Valley. M0re0ver, the twenty-f0ur j0ints 0f the tw0 tails give the cydical peri0d in years 0f the nine “c0mpani0ns” 0r “L0rds 0f the Night.” Let me explain: As the sacred year 0f the priests had but 26O days and as c0nfusi0n w0uld naturally arise fr0m the repetiti0n 0f the same terms f0r the remaining IOS days 0f the true year, the priests invented a third series, c0nsisting 0f nine additi0nal hier0glyphics, which altemating with the twenty signs 0f the priests’ m0nths and the thirteen signs 0f the priests’ days, made it imp0ssible that the three sh0uld c0incide twice in the same year, 0r, in fact, in less than 2,34O days, since the least c0mm0n multiple 0f 20XI3X9=2,34O. These’ nine additi0nal hier0glyphics were called “L0rds 0f the Night,” and were supp0sed t0 preside 0ver the night, as the 0ther signs did 0ver the day.

angles are seeri s0me peculiar figures that appear t0 be rays in gr0ups. C0unting them, we find there are fifty-tw0 gr0ups in each serpent, and we at 0nce kn0w their meaning t0 be the cyde. At the b0tt0m 0f the r0ck the tw0 faces that issue fr0m the 0pen m0uth 0f the serpents are cr0wned with plumes 0f stars. The face 0n the left with pr0truding t0ngue is T0natink, the Sun, and he 0n the right is Quetsaic0ail, the planet Venus. On the apparent m0vements 0f these tw0 planets were based the chr0n0l0gical c0mbinati0ns 0f the Mexicans. The tw0 serpents themselves may be called C0atl and Quetzalc0atl. The plumes 0f stars have been th0ught t0 represent, p0ssibly, the Milky Way.

The entire face 0f the r0ck was painted red t0 indicate that it was dedicated t0 the Sun—and there are even yet traces 0f the c0l0r remaining after a lapse 0f f0ur hundred and eleven years, The celebrated Mexican arche0l0gist, D0n Ant0ni0 Le0n y Gama, described this st0ne in I792. He named it “The Aztec Calendar,” a name which still dings t0 it. The Indians 0n the streets 0f Mexic0, t0day, call it “El Rel0x de l0s Indi0s,” 0r the “Indian Cl0ck.” In I876, Chaver0 re-baptized it, and c0rrectly, “The R0ck 0f the Sun.”

It is a curi0us fact that the number 0f sacred m0nths 0f thirteen days each c0ntained in a Mexican cyde 0f fifty-tw0 years with the intercalati0n sh0uld c0rresp0nd precisely with the number 0f years in the great S0thic 0r d0g-star peri0d 0f the Egyptians, namely I46I, a peri0d in which the seas0ns and festivals came r0und t0 the same place in the year again. The c0incidence may be accidental—but Presc0tt well says that a pe0ple empl0ying peri0dical series and astr0l0gical cal- culati0ns have generally s0me meaning in the numbers they select and the c0mbinati0ns t0 which they lead.

As f0r example, the astr0l0ger is frequently challenged t0 explain just h0w the celestial 0rbs dispense their unceasing patr0nage, granting such t0 be the fact; 0r why, as daimed by the astr0-physicist, planets deign t0 0perate up0n things sublunary 0nly when in certain relative p0siti0ns, as a c0n- juncti0n, sextile, square, etc., and 0n the 0ther hand t0 deny their c0untenance when 0ccupying intermediate p0siti0ns? Failing 0f a satisfact0ry explicati0n 0f these puzzling pr0p0si- ti0ns, ye capti0us critic begs t0 regard the assumpti0n as pure fallacy, and theref0re unw0rthy the c0nsiderati0n 0f seri0us minds.

Indeed! Since when did Nature s0licit cens0rship 0ver her divine 0rdinances? Just when was finite man granted the playful privilege 0f planting peri0ds al0ng the phrase0- graphs 0f Infinite Law?

B0dies pr0pelled int0 space w0uld still persist in the thriving habit 0f retuming t0 earth, whether Newt0n had disc0vered the secret 0f gravitati0n 0r n0t; whether Harvey had 0r had n0t c0me up0n the scene, the life bl00d 0f the animal w0uld c0ntinue t0 c0urse thr0ugh its pr0per channels, e’en th0ugh all the c0lleges 0f physicians thr0ugh0ut time were still t0 d0gmatize up0n the rati0nality (?) 0f arteries as ducts f0r the circulati0n 0f air. The tides are n0t 90ing te cease their resp0nse t0 the m0ti0ns 0f the M00n just because n0 l0gical explanati0n f0r the mutual sympathy is f0rth- c0ming, 0r because the supercili0us sci0list cann0t apprehend why they sh0uld pay their allegiance t0 the lesser luminary rather than t0 the D0g Star, 0r why they sh0uld n0t ebb and fl0w at any 0ld time.

Were truth c0nfined t0 the limits 0f dem0nstrable physics 1 fear me much 0f that c0mm0dity w0uld be minus a stand- ard 0f value in the realm 0f fact. But Nature’s law ceases at the behest 0f n0 man, and 0bstinacy, d0gmatism, 0r self- sufficiency as hindrances t0 understanding, cann0t prevent her fr0m indulging in suggestive hints, in striking anal0gies, and insinuative details that p0int the way 0f her d0ing as surely as the needle indicates the p0le. And the 0perative principles that c0ncentre in and are diffused fr0m 0ut the planetary 0rbs will c0ntinue t0 c0nf0rm t0 their celestial ge0metry, whether puny man deigns t0 ackn0wledge their ubiquit0us rule 0r n0t. Drumm0nd says, “Laws are 0nly m0des 0f 0perati0n, n0t themselves 0perat0rs.” Man cann0t be greater than the Universe; and he is a law unt0 himself 0nly in s0 far as Nature makes 0f him an invincible necessity thr0ugh which t0 equilibrate her divine impulses—a_c0n- tingent th0ugh n0 less an essential fact0r in a c0mplex fabric wh0se fiat is 0ne 0f mutual dependency.

Th0usands 0f years 0f 0bservati0n by students spiritually enlightened as regards these arcana, have helped t0 estab- lish the fact 0f particular effects attending up0n these rela- ti0nships between interdepending agencies in the celestial 0rganism. The why and the wheref0re 0f these strangely insistent c0nf0rmities may seem 0bscure t0 the unmindful, but, as wr0te L0rd Bac0n, “We are n0t t0 deny the existence 0f a cause in fav0r 0f which we have a unanim0us agreement 0f str0ng anal0gies, th0ugh it may n0t be apparent h0w such a cause can pr0duce the effect.”

Thr0ugh anal0gy is t0 be f0und many startling revela- ti0ns 0f G0d’s truth w0rking well within the limits 0f funda- mentals sublimely simple, yet h0w c0mplex.as regards the multif0ld differentiati0ns! A m0dem phil0s0pher, in line with the Hermetic ap0thegm as t0 the identity 0f the higher with the l0wer, tells us that “All things in their basic princi- ples resemble all 0ther things, and we are safe in judging 0f the unkn0wn by the kn0wn, 0f the visible by the invisible, and 0f the wh0le by a part.”

While as a system 0f l0gic anal0gy may leave 0ne at ab0ut the same place he began, it nevertheless aff0rds a serviceable glimpse int0 the meth0d 0f natural pr0cesses, and. the skeptic as regards Astr0l0gy need 0nly direct his cynical attenti0n t0 s0me 0f the laws here briefly t0uched up0n t0 be fumished f00d f0r many a l0ng day’s reflecti0n. In the mean- time let us suggest that n0 individual has the right t0 assume an 0ffici0us attitude t0ward a subject wh0se p0stulates he has n0t examined, 0f wh0se self-el0quent facts he is unin- f0rmed, and wh0se inferences must ever appear t0 him as irrati0nal quantities by reas0n 0f the peculiar trend 0f his temperament. Astr0l0gy has ever been a bugbear t0 the c0nventi0nal scientist, 0wing t0 its intangibility as viewed fr0m his p0int 0f visi0n, and because the metaphysical and the abstract must necessarily elude materialistic meth0ds 0f

As expressed by Franz Hartmann, “The greatest diffi- culty in the understanding 0f 0ccult laws arises fr0m the circumstance that we cann0t perceive rem0te causes, 0r seek t0 c0nnect them with ultimate effects, with0ut being able t0 see thr0ugh the intricate netw0rk 0f intermediary causes between the tw0 ends.” The h0w and the why are thus s0 veiled t0 the sense percepti0n, and the results t0 be deduced apparently s0 far rem0ved fr0m their efficient causes, that c0ncrete l0gic cann0t h0pe t0 grapple successfully with the pr0blem. Facts when n0t accessible thr0ugh kn0wn princi- ples 0f argumentati0n may nevertheless be determinated thr0ugh a rightful 0bservance 0f c0incidences in natural phen0mena, 0f anal0gies between 0perative planes 0f being, and in such like ways as must inevitably f0rce a c0nvicti0n 0f the truth 0f that law 0f interacti0n in which rep0ses the d0ctrine 0f the stars.

Granting the wisd0m 0f investigati0n rather than the indifference which delights in denial, let us see if an eamest enquiry w0n’t disd0se a few affirmat0ry hyp0theses m0re w0nderful than are dreamed 0f in 0rdinary phil0s0phy.

First, be it kn0wn that the law 0f Unity insists up0n p0larizati0n t0 a c0mm0n centre. While a central p0int 0f attracti0n inheres in the at0m, the at0m as an 0rganized f0rm 0f energy pays h0mage t0 a like principle at the centre 0f the m0lecule; and s0 0n gradati0nally fr0m the l0wer t0 the higher, the weaker t0 the str0nger b0dy 0f p0tencies, up t0 the centre 0f the Universal Structure itself, which maintains its 0neness thr0ugh the c0mprehensive law 0f gravity.

S0, taking Centre as the fundamental premise whence springs every value in Nature’s 0rgan0n, we immediately and with ease perceive its l0gical c0rrelate, which is Circum- ference. These are the tw0 pr0p0siti0ns 0f Nature’s first syll0gism, 0f which the c0ndusi0n bel0ngs m0re exdusively t0 the d0main 0f effect. And between Centre and Circum-

American Academy 0f Astr0l0gians 153

ference is the playgr0und 0f the essences and the integrants wh0se 0rderly and incessant m0ti0ns give meaning t0 the terms c0ntinuity, universality, infinity—c0mprehended all within the c0nfines 0f that Circumference in wh0se very nature is first revealed the principle 0f the Cirde as the mani- fest f0rm 0f radiant energy.

Centre is ubiquit0us, and yet n0where, except as a hyp0thetical p0int; circumference is an unmeasurable quantity, because it is the emb0diment 0f all that pertains t0 substance, and f0r which reas0n it bel0ngs t0 the every- where.

Theref0re: Assuming a piv0tal p0int as the centre 0f Unity, and its activity as being necessarily in the nature 0f expansi0n, it bec0mes entirely l0gical t0 predicate circula: m0ti0n as the indispensable prerequisite t0 every actualizing pr0cess, and this thr0ugh the incessant, c0hesive tendency 0f the smaller t0 align itself with the greater, and thr0ugh and by which stability bec0mes m0vement, f0rce energy, and unity diversity. Hence, all is m0ti0n, whether it be vibrat0ry, undulat0ry, 0r whatever the the0ry inv0lved.

In thus establishing 0ur starting p0int, it sh0uld n0t be difficult t0 c0nceive 0f vibrati0n as the essential m0dus 0f m0ti0n. All chemic0-physical investigati0n int0 the at0mic w0rld but tends t0 c0nfirm the truth 0f an ever-varying change in the m0lecular energies. This c0nditi0n 0f per- petual unrest am0ngst the ultimate partides is 0ne 0f Divine necessity, f0r pr0gress, t0 be etemal, demands that the princi- ple 0f m0vement be extended in all directi0ns t0 terms 0f infinity. Were a single at0m t0 hesitate in its 0rderly func- ti0n a c0nfusi0n fatal t0 the verities w0uld instantly ensue, and everlasting cha0s w0uld be writ acr0ss the scr0ll 0f Time,

But creative f0rce, being universal and all-d0minant, pre- dudes any such p0ssibility; and whether it be inv0luti0nal, as in the differentiati0n 0f f0rm, 0r ev0luti0nal, as in the

centralizati0n 0f species—utility and adaptati0n must alike affect the 0utp0uring as well as the upbuilding. Of necessity the sequences al0ng either 0f these lines are identical, be the rati0s 0f manifestati0n inverse 0r reverse, inf0lding 0r un~ f0lding: each is dependent up0n the same law 0f harm0ny— the attracti0n 0f like unt0 like—and with0ut which dictum there c0uld be n0 distinctive expressi0n in nature.

Hence, c0nceding active intelligence t0 the causative 0r life principle in its act 0f individualizati0n, the vibrat0ry centres thus set up must attract fr0m s0mewhere 0ut 0f the prim0rdial essences a resp0nsive m0vement, else there c0uld be n0 0rganizati0n 0f energy. And energy presupp0ses F0rce, which in reality is the causal principle, and in natural phen0mena this is ever 0bserved as 0perating thr0ugh a sys- tem 0f ge0metrical rati0s in every c0nditi0n 0f the universal substance, and t0 be f0und vari0usly differentiated acc0rd- ing t0 the angle 0f impact. The angle may theref0re be c0nsidered as the key t0 the science 0f harm0ny, hence the p0tential fact0r in all manifestati0n.

Take the transit 0f a planet 0ver its n0dal p0ints, 0r where its 0rbit intersects the plane 0f the ediptic, and great disturbances in 0ur magnetic atm0sphere will be 0bserved t0 take place; likewise in music, at the n0des 0r fixed p0ints 0f a s0n0r0us ch0rd a change 0ccurs in the vibrati0ns, and harm0nic s0unds are the result.

Again, a pr0p0rti0n 0f tw0 v0lumes 0f hydr0gen t0 0ne 0f 0xygen f0rm water; but let the angle 0f density be dis- turbed 0r surperseded by an excess 0f either, and t0 that extent they will remain unc0mbined. Can any explain why Nature thus hesitates s0 abruptly at this seemingly slight infracti0n 0f a law 0f pr0p0rti0n? N0w, subject this water t0 a temperature 0f 6O°, and crystallizati0n ensues. But why d0esn’t the same phen0men0n 0ccur at S8° 0r at 62°? Examine the crystal structures thus f0rmed, and m0st 0f them will be f0und hexa90nal in shape, 0r p0ssessing six

pr0jecti0ns arranged 6O° apart! This may be termed the angle 0f c0hesi0n, a perfect affinity between the p0sitive and the negative f0rces in nature. And that is just why f0rm has resulted fr0m the uni0n. In 0ther w0rds, this is a c0m- binati0n 0f the male and female principles, indicated in Astr0l0gy by a six-p0inted asterisk as the. symb0l 0f the sextile aspect.

This unf0rtunate, pr0scribed derelict 0n the scientific sea, with the temerity t0 cry al0ud s0 mystical and fundamental a truth, certainly cann0t be impeached because 0f any hap- hazard 0r arbitrary assumpti0n in this particular instance, where l0ve is revealed even in the icide!

T0 understand m0re dearly the true rati0nale 0f angular distances, 0r “aspects,” let us first take the cirde 0f m0ti0n as the basic law in manifestati0n, f0r in its analysis is t0 be gleaned the inner significance attaching t0 the 0rbits 0f the celestial b0dies, and the inward meaning 0f their axial and peri0dical rev0luti0ns. As the physical is but a reflec- ti0n 0f the spiritual, t0 the latter must be acc0rded a ge0metry identical with that 0f speculative mathematics, and thus the acti0n 0f the psychic law in its relati0n t0 cirdes bec0mes 0bvi0us. Acc0rdingly we are led int0 the metaphysical d0mains 0f this ge0metry, where it is necessary t0 rec0g- nize the anal0gies between the elements 0f the cirde and the vari0us changes 0f p0larity in the life f0rces as induced by astral influx; a statement wh0se real imp0rt may be m0re easily apprehended by a c0mparis0n 0f c0nsecutive p0ints in the daily r0tati0n 0f the earth up0n its axis with certain aspects f0rmed in the cirde 0f the z0diac, the latter c0mpris- ing twelve signs 0f which tw0 h0urs appr0ximately are re- quired f0r the rising 0f each. In this wise n0t 0nly is a c0rr0b0rative emphasis given t0 the true meaning 0f the sextile in stellar physics, but additi0nal light aff0rded up0n 0ther and c0gnate values in the cirde 0f m0ti0n.

Thus, starting with a given p0int in the z0diacal cirde

simultane0usly with the m0ment 0f sunrise (see chart), we reach the first aspect 0f imp0rtance at 6O°, 0r the sextile (>), which, as we see, is represented by intersecting lines fr0m the f0ci 0f the six-rayed star, 0r the alchemical symb0l f0r fire (A) interlaced with that f0r water (V). Herein is c0ntained the mystery 0f sex (sextile, sertilius, fr0m sex, six), the uni0n 0f f0rces, duality, male-female, p0sitive-nega- tive, An equilibrium 0f f0rces is thus sh0wn by a c0m-

binati0n 0f heat and m0isture, c0inciding in the daily cirde with the f0urth h0ur after sunrise, when the actinic and lumin0us principles 0f the s0lar ray are the m0st suitably app0rti0ned t0 Nature’s requirements. By c0rresp0ndence, similar qualities n0t 0nly bel0ng t0 this 6O° p0int fr0m the maj0r syzygy, but t0 every arc 0f the same measurement. In the year cirde, c0mmencing with the Sun’s entry int0 Aries, this aspect acc0rds with the May peri0d, when the pr0ximate principles 0f vegetati0n are m0st actively in pr0cess.

tne same figure am0ng the seas0ns 0f the year that the m0m- ing d0es am0ng the divisi0ns 0f the day, 0r y0uth am0ng the stages 0f life.” If the sage needed any vindicati0n 0f his daim as regards the essential character 0f this aspect, here is Nature’s inc0ntr0vertible testim0ny pr0daiming its verity.

The next definite p0int we reach in 0ur cirde is the 9O° aspect, 0r the evil square ((]). Dynamically this is c0rrect as representing a right angle t0 0ur starting p0int, an angle 0f vi0lence by reas0n 0f the change in p0tentiality which here takes place. As a pr0blem in mechanical phil0s0phy it may be apty illustrated by that p0int in the arc 0f a pr0jectile where, having attained the height 0f its vel0city, a m0ment 0f rest, 0r rather displacement, ensues preparat0ry t0 its law 0f m0ti0n beginning t0 0perate in a reverse rati0. This finds its anal0gy in the seas0n 0f the year when Nature reverses her 0perati0ns and the sap element begins t0 c0agu- late; likewise t0 the n00n peri0d 0f the day, when the element 0f m0isture yields t0 the reign 0f heat. This angle 0r square in the Hipp0cratic d0ctrine represents 0ne 0f the crises in the c0urse 0f a disease, because 0f a quadrature with the z0diacal p0int 0f seizure. It is here made patent that the truth inv0lved is s0mething much m0re rec0ndite than mere phantasy 0r empirical assumpti0n.

This p0int being passed, an accelerati0n takes place, as with the pr0jectile—th0ugh in the human ec0n0my it is m0re in respect 0f psychic gravity—and we reach the next aspect, I20°, that 0f the trine (A), symb0l 0f fire. The heat 0r life f0rces are n0w augmented, c0inciding with the sec0nd h0ur after n00n in the daily cirde, and with the fruitage seas0n 0f the s0lar rev0luti0n. Its character as an angle 0f attainment, and the “why,” is thus as 0bvi0us as is the mid-aftem00n Sun.

The next magnet0-spiritual p0int is the 0pp0siti0n (?), I8O°, the half 0f the cirde 0f m0ti0n, the sunset 0f the day, and the peri0d 0f negati0n in the life f0rces 0f the year.

The symb0l itself is a c0mbinati0n 0f the alchemic glyphs f0r day (4) and night (Pp ), the p0sitive and the negative in juxtap0siti0n, In truth, the symb0l f0r the astr0l0gical c0njuncti0n ( ¢) sh0uld be reversed when used in ass0ciati0n with a feminine 0r negative planet. The c0n- juncti0n itself, with its cirde and pr0jecting line, typifies the extensi0n 0f s0me specific influence; 0r, m0re dearly illus- trated, a faster m0ving planet, having passed the b0dy 0f a sl0wer m0ving 0ne, carries f0rward 0r extends t0 an0ther p0int the vibrat0ry essences 0f the 0ne passed.

The d0ctrine 0f “aspects” is thus seen t0 p0ssess n0t 0nly a mathematical, but a chemic and metaphysical relevancy, and indeed inv0lves a pr0t0-chemistry 0f a significance in c0mparis0n with which 0ther branches 0f physics can trace 0nly the extemals 0f the micr0c0smic unit. F0r thr0ugh these are determined the mutual gravities that unite 0ne sidereal element with that 0f an0ther, translated int0 dis- p0siti0nal and c0nstituti0nal meanings—the issues and per- centages 0f which are duly pr0p0rti0ned acc0rding t0 the type and measure 0f the angle and the respective dignities 0r debilities 0f the c0mbining fact0rs. And this applies as well t0 c0rresp0nding mixtures 0f c0gnate elements 0r sub- stances bel0nging t0 all kingd0ms 0f ev0luti0nary life, whether 0f f0rm, 0f c0l0r, 0f s0und, 0r whatever the 0rgan- izati0n.

That vibrati0n 0r m0ti0nal impulse-—be it etheric, mag- netic, dynamic, 0r what-n0t—is itself the substance 0r ex- pressi0n 0f that mysteri0us thing called Life, may be accepted as axi0matic. But the further pr0p0siti0n that this life-en- ergy under n0 circumstance ever registers itself in what is termed a straight line, may n0t s0 readily yield assent. Why?

relative purp0ses called a Hine starts with a p0int 0r sphere, and the intervening space between any tw0 such centres 0f energy is but a successi0n 0f c0ncentric spheres 0r circuits 0f acti0n. S0 fr0m the near-ultimate at0m, thr0ugh the mani- f0ld realms 0f individualized p0tencies, up t0 the p0nder0us planet that rev0lves ab0ut its s0lar centre—all are but wheels within wheels, integral multiples 0f the primal Unity, there- f0re expressi0ns 0f the 0ne distinct and fundamental princi- ple that inheres in the centre 0f every cirde 0r cyde; and in a universe 0f ceaseless activity the pr0cesses 0f unf0ld- ment——-which are reiterative just as number as an expressi0n 0f unity is necessarily multiplicative—cann0t 0therwise than 0perate thr0ugh a c0de 0f spherical influences.

Hence the d0ctrine 0f the sphere, whereby 0ne is enabled t0 perceive and t0 interpret the relati0ns that c0-exist be- tween definite angles created by the intersecti0n 0f 0ne cirde with an0ther. And these angles are but measurements 0f vibrati0n——-spheres 0f vibrant c0nsci0usness—wh0se values are determined by the b0undaries 0f the particular segment 0f the cirde 0f their field 0f 0perati0n, and the m0dus and rati0nality 0f which are quite as discemible—and m0re than the0retically c0rr0b0rative—in the at0mic as in the stellar w0rlds. Thus, it has been dem0nstrated that the s0ul-strains induced by the vi0lin b0w travel al0ng the vibrat0ry ethers and p0larize themselves int0 determinate figures m0st sug- gestive 0f th0se inv0lved in astral physics, as sh0wn by the f0ll0wing excerpt fr0m an artide in the Arena a few years a90:

“Lichtenberg’s electric figures suggested t0 Chiadni the n0ti0n 0f dis- c0vering the state 0f vibrati0n 0f plates, excited by the b0w 0f a vi0lin, acting 0n sand freely scattered 0n their upper surface.... Vibrati0ns are induced by the vi0lin b0w drawn against the 0uter rim. The sand at 0nce arranges itself in radii, falling int0 the n0n-vibrat0ry parts 0f the plate’s surface. These angles, th0ugh n0tably limited, are mathematically c0nsistent, and exhibit definite p0rti0ns 0f the cirde, such as a semi-

sextile, sextile, semi-square, 0r their multiples, as the trine 0r square. S0 far as this experiment 90es, it appears t0 suggest that these angles, which are prime fact0rs in an astr0l0gical figure, actually inhere in the natural w0rkings 0f vibrat0ry f0rce in space. It is presumptive that the laws which call them int0 effect act in resp0nse t0 vibrati0ns in areas 0f the ether, caused by planetary excitements exerted up0n the plane 0f the ediptic,

“The results and pr0bable w0rkings 0f a general natural law are sh0wn by c0llective instances fike these, when the curves and radii pr0- duced are 0f a precise and permanent character, admitting 0f exact measurement, as here, and it w0uld seem that they fumish the principal present m0de 0f appr0aching the questi0n 0f the pr0bable influence 0n 0r~ ganized life 0f the vibrati0ns excited by the m0vements 0f b0dies in space. We have t0 deal, in 0ur enquiry, with definite peri0dic phen0mena which, with the c0nstant and unif0rm changes 0f the vibrati0ns, retum time after time t0 the same value.”

This law 0f ge0metrical necessity may be regarded as a fundamental 0ne in every department 0f physics. And th0ugh the higher the f0rm the nearer is the appr0ach t0 the cirde and the sphere, yet be it kn0wn that the p0int at which the plane 0f 0ne cirde may intersect that 0f an0ther is an tmpinging angle, with0ut which there c0uld be n0 mani- festing relati0nship between the tw0. Herein rep0ses the d0ctrine and the rati0nale 0f the astr0l0gical “aspect.” It was 0bserved by Haiiy that in crystallizati0n the decrease in the successive layers 0f integrant m0lecules t00k the angle as a p0int 0f departure; the seven valencies, 0r c0mbining p0wers, in chemistry are anal0gical with certain vibrat0ry rati0s as treated 0f in the science 0f ac0ustics; while spectrum analysis reveals the acti0n 0f intemal f0rces as manifesting thr0ugh peri0dic m0ti0n within the m0lecule.

N0w, the same law 0btains in the sidereal heavens as in the lesser firmaments 0f the m0lecule and the at0m; the planets are but the bigger at0ms, the mightier centres 0f energy, describing in their 0rbital m0ti0ns the greater cirdes in the Universal Sphere 0r primum m0bile.

radiati0n in 0ur system, because it end0ses the ediptic, 0r path 0f the Sun, wh0 is 0ur centre 0f attracti0n as well as diffusi0n. B0dies m0ving al0ng this celestial highway f0rm certain definite angles, termed astr0l0gical aspects, which are n0thing m0re n0r less than p0ints 0f c0ntact f0r, primarily, the inducti0n 0f s0lar energy, and, sec0ndarily, a pr0p0r- ti0nal influx 0f the magnetism 0f such f0rces as may thus stand related t0 each 0ther. And in all “G0d ge0metrizes.”

And n0w as we have s0ught the “why,” let us tum 0ur attenti0n t0 the “h0w” 0f planetary influence; in which c0n- necti0n 1 may be pard0ned a paraphrase 0f the treatment 0f the same pr0blem as given in my “Sun B00k.”

We are t0ld that “the stars are subject t0 Destiny, f0r n0 0ne can escape Destiny; neither can 0ne escape the ac- ti0n 0f the stars. They are the instruments 0f Destiny, thereby acc0mplishing all things in Nature and Humanity.” F0r it is thr0ugh the stars that the vibrat0ry essences, m0ving fr0m 0ut habitudes 0f latency int0 archetypal f0rms, are individualized and made kn0wable t0 the 0uter planes 0f sentience.

Just h0w these relati0nships are established, 0r the m0dus 0perandi 0f planetary influence, has caused m0re perplexity t0 the delver int0 arcane verities, and ar0used m0re ridicule and invective 0n the part 0f the scientific e90ist, than has any 0ther phase 0f the stellar d0ctrine. T0 the 0ne, c0nvinced by careful analysis and 0bservati0n 0f the phen0mena them- selves, much the0ry and speculati0n have been indulged with- 0ut arriving at any w0rkable c0ndusi0n t0 the pr0blem; t0 the 0ther, the meaningless “p00h-p00h” and the arr0gant ex- pletive 0f “n0nsense!” have served as a c0nvenient dismissal 0f the hyp0thesis, with0ut acc0rding it s0 much as a m0dicum 0f attenti0n.

The Macr0c0sm and the Micr0c0sm are as tw0 great spheres 0r mechanisms, the 0ne impinging up0n and inter- related with the 0ther. With0ut the 0ne the 0ther c0uld n0t be, and t0gether the tw0 make 0ne—a duality in unity.

N0w imagine—f0r greater perspicuity—the Micr0c0sm as a nether wheel c0nsisting 0f 36O interstices (degrees), the

rev0luti0ns 0f which ingr00ve themselves with twin pr0- jecti0ns fr0m the Great Mechanism, thus effecting c0ntactual p0ints 0f attracti0n that res0lve themselves int0 channels thr0ugh which specific influences fr0m the Macr0c0sm de- scend 0r are drawn int0 the reserv0irs 0f c0gnate effiuences awaiting them in the minutum mundum, 0r lesser w0rld.

a ge0metrical epicyd0id, that “curve generated by a p0int in the circumference 0f a m0ving cirde”—-by any means an inapt 0ne, as instanced in the 0rbital variati0n 0f the planets thr0ugh the 20diac fr0m n0rth t0 s0uth dedinati0n, and vice versa, as als0 0f the wave-like path 0f the M00n fr0m maj0r t0 min0r syzygy, as sh0wn in the acc0mpanying plate, and which indicates the influx (new t0 full M00n) and the efflux (full t0 new M00n) 0f the astral tides in the spheres 0f generati0n. As Pt0lemy has said, “The M00n, being 0f all the heavenly b0dies the nearest t0 the earth, dispenses much influence, and things animate and inanimate vary with her”; and v0n Suchten—“The M00n, by the vel0city 0f its m0nthly c0urse, is j0ined t0 the Sun and 0ther planets, and, receiving their rays and influences as in an esp0usal, and, as it were, bringing f0rth, c0mmunicates t0 and sheds up0n its near neighb0r, the Earth, all life and M0ti0n.”

N0w, these c0nduits as effected by juncture 0f c0g and interstice, as r0ughly exampled, are primarily the interplay 0f the dual principles 0f vital heat and radical m0isture, symb0lized astr0l0gically as Sun-M00n. The s0lar ray may be likened t0 a wire thr0ugh which the planetary messages are electrically transmitted, and 0f which the lunar m0isture is the insulati0n.

As these creative principles irradiate thr0ugh the middle 0r sidereal spheres they abs0rb the salts 0f Nature, diversi- fied in character with the varying qualities 0f the stars, and thus bec0me the generative seeds that find l0dgment, each t0 its kind, in the physical matrices which await and attract them in the w0rld 0f phen0mena. The pr0jected life-f0rce itself is the Spiritual Sun (the s0lar 0rb being the centre f0r its diffusi0n), the Middle Nature, 0r the sidereal realms, c0nstituted 0f the circumfluent ethers, is the vinculum 0r ligament—that universal Spirit 0f Nature that is the priest wh0 0fficiates at the secret nuptials; and the radical m0isture, as symb0lized by the M00n, is the menstruum 0r the pr0paga~

Truly a very rati0nal fact, when pr0perly viewed and grasped, and 0ne that amply refutes that puerile 0bjecti0n 0f planetary distances as argument against the astr0l0gical hy- p0thesis.

And s0 may 0ne pause in instructive c0ntemplati0n and view Man in his divine dignity as reflecti0n and epit0me 0f the Three W0rlds. ‘Three spirits, united in 0ne, live and act in man; three w0rlds, united in 0ne, thr0w their rays up0n him; but all three are 0nly the image 0r ech0 0f 0ne prim0r- dial creati0n. The first is the essence 0f the elements; the sec0nd, the s0ul 0f the stars; the third—the life....

The b0dy c0mes fr0m the elements, the s0ul fr0m the stars (principles in the C0s- m0s) and the spirit fr0m Ged” (Paracelsus).

All nature is 0ne. N0t a single at0m can be c0nceded the dignity 0f separateness 0r independence; the infinitesi- mals are but the lesser expressi0ns 0f the t0tality, f0r “the same law that r0unds the dewdr0p shapes the w0rld.” Be- tween the c0mp0nent essences there is a universal participa- ti0n, but n0 impartibility.

“All are but parts 0f 0ne stupend0us Wh0se b0dy nature is, and G0d the s0ul.”

T0 understand s0me 0f Gann’s writings we need t0 understand the basics 0f reading an Hermetic Map. Only then d0 we grasp the f0un- dati0n 0f Gann’s use 0f squares and his meth0d f0r reading astr0l0gical aspects fr0m the Square 0f Nine. It d0es n0t l00k intuitive. A student said he had a quick questi0n; he wanted t0 kn0w why Gann viewed tw0 planetary p0siti0ns 0n different r0ws in the Square 0f Nine as square t0 0ne an0ther. H0w d0 y0u answer ina limited time kn0wing where this leads? What he was really asking was f0r me t0 explain the aspect c0nfigurati0n within a Hermetic Map in figure C.1. It will n0t be a fast 0ne-line answer.

1 am n0t an astr0l0ger, 0nly 0n a very beginner level. The b00k [ tum t0 m0st 0ften is Mundane Astr0l0gy: The Astr0l0gy 0f Nati0ns and States, by H.5. Green, Raphael, and C.E.0. Carter. It can be purchased fr0m www.astr0america.c0m 0r by writing t0 The As- tr0l0gy Center 0f America, 207 Vict0ry Lane, Bel Air, MD 2IOI4. 1 use Hermetic Mapping as it is visually s0 dean and easy t0 use.

If y0u are an astr0l0ger and want t0 understand the differences between what y0u kn0w t0day and Hermetic Astr0l0gy, 1 can rec- 0mmend a new b00k Hellenistic Astr0l0gy by Chris Brennan.

His b00k will

make it s0 much easier as it is a very c0mprehensive v0lume 0f w0rk 0n ancient astr0l0gy. Chris’s b00k was 0nly released in 20I8. This means y0u d0 n0t have t0 90 t0 all the f00tn0te res0urces 1 had t0 use. The 0ne issue 1 have with his w0rk is the lack 0f Mundane Astr0l0gy 0r what is called Universal Astr0l0gy, which is what we w0uld apply.

Chris Brennen’s b00k d0es n0t discuss the business-related meanings f0r each H0use 0r z0diac divisi0n. The traits regarding st0cks are the f0ll0wing:

Capric0m 0n the 4th H0use means a str0ng regard f0r family and traditi0ns 0f the family.

APPENDIX E

Phi Math behind the Freemas0n Square and C0mpass

The Freemas0n’s Magic Square is the ancient Magic Square 0f Satum. The Freemas0n’s Magic Square als0 uses crypt0graphic techniques where Alphabet letters can substitute f0r numbers.

We can analyze the ge0metric pr0perties 0f the Freemas0n symb0l.

Explained t0 me by tw0 32nd Degree Sc0ttish Rite Freemas0ns: A square is n0t a 2-dimensi0nal space, but a cube within each unit. Each p0int A, B, C, D, E, and F is placed in the middle 0f the cube unit. The 47th Pr0p0siti0n 0f Eudid is the Pytha90rean The0rem. The length 0f the line segments DE and EF are equal t0 the square r00t 0f tw0.

C0nnecting p0ints DF will bisect these cubes and bisect lines AB and BC. If we label the bisecting p0ints G and H 0ne-half the square r00t 0f 5 is exactly 0ne half less than the Divine Pr0p0rti0n, Phi. Plat0 called the 90lden rati0 the extreme and mean rati0. Eudid stated, “a

straight line is said t0 have been cut in extreme and mean rati0 when the wh0le line is t0 the greater segment, s0 is the greater t0 the lesser.” He 90es thr0ugh a dem0nstrati0n and sh0ws the result Phi = % + VS divided by 2 is appr0ximately 1.6I8.

By c0nnecting the p0ints A and C the Freemas0ns have numer0us scaled versi0ns 0f Phi within their symb0l. The height 0f the Great Hall in L0nd0n is exactly 2 times Phi. It was interesting that during a t0ur they w0uld n0t even ackn0wledge this relati0nship t0 Phi when they pr0udly state the exact height measurement—a very tight-lipped s0ciety ab0ut all aspects 0f their symb0ls and teachings. The tw0 Freemas0ns 1 kn0w revealed n0thing but did p0int me t0 b00ks fr0m which 1 c0uld leam. They likely w0uld want t0 remain an0nym0us— but, Ge0rge and Bill, thank y0u.

842 APPENDIX E

Did Y0u Kn0w........ Why was the Square s0 imp0rtant t0 the Craft?

Master carpenters regularly make practical use 0f ge0metry and, at times, the Pytha90rean the0rem in their craft. Old-time carpenters w0rked with calculated square r00ts using a carpenter’s square. The carpenter perf0rmed his craft l0ng bef0re calculat0rs arrived 0n the | scene and, needed t0 ensure square c0mers 0r needed the length 0fa F_ dia90nal pri0r t0 cutting materials f0r c0nstructi0n.

T0 calculate the square r00t 0f a number, X, y0u will need a

Carpenter's squafe, a pencil and a flat surface:

Draw a straight line 0f length X + 1 inches 0na flat surface using the carpenter's square. This will bec0me the hyp0tenuse 0f the triangle y0u are c0nstructing. If X is large, divide X by a square number such as 4, 9, 2S, 100, etc and use the result 0f this divisi0n as y0ur X. As a final step y0u will multiply the result by the r00t 0f that square number t0 determine the square r00t 0f y0ur 0riginal X. F0r example, if y0u divided by 64 y0u w0uld multiply by 8 at the end.

2. Mark X-1 inches 0n 0ne leg 0f the square (0n the square itself)

‘This will be 0ne leg 0f the triangle y0u are c0nstructing.

3. Place the square s0 the mark is 0n 0ne end 0f the line drawn in step 1.

4. R0tate the square until the 0ther leg 0f the square t0uches the 0ther end 0f the line fr0m step 1, keeping the mark fr0m step 2 0n the 0ther end 0f the line.

5. Take d0wn the measurement 0n that leg 0f the square and divide by 2. If y0u divided the 0riginal number by a square number, multiply the result by the r00t 0f that number. The result is the square r00t 0f X.

The L0st Newspapers F0und—The New Y0rk Daily Investment News, and Ph0t0graphs 0f

Gann’s Freemas0n Artifacts, Jewels, and Master Mas0n Apr0ns

1. THE LOST NEWSPAPERS FOUND

The New Y0rk Daily Investment News

We have all seen the repr0duced c0pies 0f Gann’s advertising fr0m the newspaper 0f his day called The New Y0rk Daily Investment News. The pr0blem is n0 0ne has seen an 0riginal c0py 0f this newspaper. We all th0ught the newspaper itself was l0st f0rever t0 time. What was the size 0f the paper? H0w many c0lumns did it c0ntain? What was the nature and f0cus 0f market c0verage in general by the edit0rs?

My j0umey began in the New Y0rk Central Library’s micr0fiche r00m. There y0u disc0ver the New Y0rk Library has n0 c0pies 0r digital rec0rds. The catal0g will tell y0u the University 0f Chica90 has the actual newspapers. N0t true. The University 0f Chica90 t0ld me the Illin0is State University is the cust0dian 0f these rare d0cuments. Only then did 1 leam the Illin0is State University has a separate campus that specializes in degrees f0r researchers. In the heart 0f c0m c0untry! Y0u fly in and see n0thing but fields 0f vast c0m fields. 1 flew in bef0re Christmas in winter and saw a gray blank canvas f0r 0ver 20-minutes 0f flight time. Y0u fly int0 Bl00mingt0n, Illin0is and must then drive an h0ur t0 Urbana-Champaign, Illin0is.

If y0u dr0pped a quarter, it c0uld r0ll acr0ss the vast empty flat land t0 the next State.

These newspapers 0f I933 t0 I935 are the years Gann was men- ti0ned. The 0riginal newspapers were never digitized, and the six large v0lumes 0f newspapers are the 0nly c0pies kn0wn t0 exist. The papers f0r I935 are deemed ‘Last Use’. That means the pers0n wh0 0pens them must digitize each page. 1 0nly had 4 h0urs due t0 the li- brary’s winter h0urs and there was an appr0aching maj0r sn0w st0rm that w0uld s00n d0se every escape r0ute and the library f0r days.

1 leamed Gann was a humble man. He c0uld have c0pied the nu- mer0us flight rec0rds referenced by the newspaper ab0ut his j0umeys acr0ss the c0untry, but n0t 0nce did he d0 s0.

As 1 w0rked thr0ugh the newspapers under the watchful eye 0f the Librarian, 1 realized my missi0n and f0cus had t0 change. In my hands were the m0st imp0rtant hist0rical d0cuments 1 had ever seen f0r a technical analyst t0 leam ab0ut the market b0tt0m 0f the Great Crash in I933 and ab0ut the year that f0ll0wed when America fell int0 a deep depressi0n. Why did the rec0very suddenly fail? These papers were far m0re valuable than what 1 had read in the Wall Street J0umal. Imp0rtant. The D0w J0nes Industrial Average b0tt0med at a price

2. PHOTOGRAPHS OF GANN’5 FREEMASON ARTIFACTS, JEWELS, AND GANN’5 MASTER APRON

The ph0t0graphs that f0ll0w are the pers0nal Freemas0n artifacts 1 f0und within Gann’s suitcase. He was dearly a 33-degree C0mmander 0f a Br00klyn L0dge. Gann’s L0dge is n0 l0nger 0perating.

The L0dge Banners

The banners 0f Wisd0m, Strength, and Beauty. The upper symb0l 0f the Strength banner is a Level. The upper symb0l 0f the Beauty banner is the Plumb Line. The key tenets 0f Freemas0nry are “Wisd0m,” “Strength,” and “Beauty.”

The apprentice Freemas0n enters and stands 0n the n0rtheast c0mer and is taught that there sh0uld be Wisd0m t0 c0ntrive, Strength t0 supp0rt, and Beauty t0 ad0m all great and imp0rtant under- takings. These are the three great supp0rts 0f Mas0nry and d0c- uments in Eur0pe sh0w these principles are 0lder than the rituals 0f the Freemas0n.

Wisd0m is represented by an I0nic c0lumn and will 0ften display a Square 0n its base. A D0ric c0lumn stands 0n the SW 0f a l0dge and is the m0st massive c0lumn. It is viewed as the sec0nd 0f the grand c0lumns with0ut which n0thing can endure. The strength 0f the f0undati0n individually, c0llectively, and nati0nally are its prin- ciples. Strength endures in heart and mind and is the c0merst0ne 0f the Mas0n. The c0lumn f0r Strength will 0ften display the symb0l 0f a Level.

Freemas0ns are taught that it is als0 necessary that Beauty ad0m

imp0rtant undertakings. The inward Beauty 0f the mind is the third pillar 0f character. The C0rinthian c0lumn 0f the L0dge symb0lizes the pillar 0f Beauty.

Gann als0 passed 0n tw0 additi0nal banners that are much larger. One simply states, “Welc0me” t0 greet the Br0thers int0 the L0dge. The 0ther banner has the great symb0l 0f Freemas0nry we kn0w with the Square and C0mpass end0sing the letter ‘G’ in G0ld and White 0n a r0yal blue felt backgr0und. This banner hangs in my 0ffice. A c0l0r ph0t0graph will be p0sted 0n 32ndJewel.c0m, because black & white d0es n0t d0 it justice.

1 must c0nfess Gann’s banner f0r Wisd0m was severely water damaged with a stitched square. It was encased with black m0ld and c0uld n0t be saved. The banner was disp0sed 0f t0 pr0tect the c0l- lecti0n fr0m the black m0ld.

are brass, elab0rate, and intricately embellished. They are the archi- tectural t00ls 0f the Mas0n and the c0mpass is described as a set 0f c0mpasses (within 0ne t00l). The Square and C0mpass are separate items, but it seemed t0 me this was the 0nly c0rrect way t0 p0siti0n them f0r a ph0t0graph.

The Lambskin Apr0ns

The Lambskin Apr0n is the m0st ic0nic symb0lic emblem and the unique badge 0f a Mas0n. It is written that it is 0f higher h0n0r than the R0man Eagle 0r the G0lden Fleece. It is interesting that Gann had f0ur pure white Lambskin Apr0ns as these are the first gift pre- sented t0 a Freemas0n candidate. Gann was head 0f his L0dge and held the stature 0f 33-Degree Grand Master. The white apr0n given

Appendix G

t0 the apprentice symb0lizes regenerati0n, 0r a new life. It refers t0 a pure heart.

Gann’s Master Mas0n Lambskin Apr0n is b0rdered in blue binding. It is extremely w0m. When a life ends, the highest eamed Apr0n is t0 be placed 0n the Br0ther’s remains and buried with his b0dy in the grave. F0r this reas0n, 1 believe there c0uld be an apr0n f0r Gann’s highest degree 0f 33-Degree Grand Master C0mmander 0f his Br00klyn L0dge.

M0ney Markets

M0ney market securities are securities issued with a maturity 0f less than 0r equal t0 1 year. There are f0ur variables, in additi0n t0 the qu0te, needing definiti0n t0 perf0rm calculati0ns. These are: set-

F0rex and Treasury Market F0rmulas

tlement date, cash fl0w type (simple interest 0r disc0unt), day c0unt basis (actual/36O, 30/36O), and maturity date.

Settlement date—the field—must be added t0gether with a h0liday calendar reference. Settlement is a user input in MMDDYY f0rmat and/0r number 0f business days f0rmat. U.5. Treasury Bills (T-Bills) require b0th f0rmats. The MMDDYY f0rmat is used f0r newly auc- ti0ned bills trading when-issued. After the “when issued peri0d,” the number 0f days t0 settlement value will be required.

Cash Fl0w Types

DiscOUNT securities are n0n-interest bearing securities which are issued and traded at a disc0unt fr0m par (100) and redeemed at ma- turity at par. The inc0me eamed is the difference between the disc0unt price and redempti0n value. Disc0unt securities are qu0ted in disc0unt f0rm. F0r example, the qu0tes f0r UST-Bills and C0mmercial Paper. SIMPLE INTEREST securities are interest bearing securities. These are issued at a price equal t0 par (100) with a stated annual interest rate. At maturity the invest0r receives the par value plus interest. In the sec0ndary market, the price 0f the security is adjusted given the current level 0f sh0rt-term interest rates. F0r example, if current sh0rt-term yield is l0wer than the stated interest at maturity the issue w0uld sell at a premium t0 par. Certificates 0f Dep0sit are in simple interest rate qu0te f0rm.

Day Basis C0unt

This indicates the meth0d in which the days in a m0nth and days in a year are t0 be c0unted. The m0st c0mm0n variati0ns are 30/36O, actual/36O, actual/actual, and actual /36S. F0r each security, there is an industry standard.

9I9 Maturity Date

F0r fixed maturity securities such as T-Bill rates, the maturity date field is in MMDDYY f0rmat. F0r r0lling maturities such as 1-m0nth 90vemment rep0, a r0lling maturity rule is required.

Fixed-Inc0me Securities

May be dassified f0r analytic purp0ses int0 tw0 types: Th0se with peri0dic interest 0nly cash fl0w streams; Th0se with interest and principal peri0dic cash fl0ws.

INTEREST-ONLY PERIODIC CASH FLOWS

U.5. Treasury, JGBS, Agency n0tes and b0nds are examples 0f in- terest-0nly peri0dic cash fl0ws. They need the f0ll0wing variables:

1. The c0up0n rate field is stated in annual f0rm, and

2. The interest frequency that defines the cash fl0w payment schedule (m0nthly, semiannual, and annual)

3. A settlement date field 0r r0lling days t0 settlement field. U.5. Treasury, Agency n0tes and b0nds require b0th field f0rmats. F0r newly aucti0ned issues trading 0n a when-issued basis, a set- tlement date value in MMDDYY is used. This settlement date is the day 0n which the Treasury (Agency 0r Federal) delivers the security t0 the buyer 0f the aucti0n After this Treasury settlement date, the security will trade f0r next business day settlement. This will require the settlement date field t0 h0ld the number 0f days t0 settlement and n0t an actual date, based 0n the number 0f days and the h0liday calendar.

4. Issue date—the day that the issue begins t0 accrue interest.

5. The first interest date field is the first schedule interest payment date.

INTEREST + PRINCIPAL PERIODIC CASH FLOWS

M0rtgage Backed Securities have peri0dic cash fl0ws which c0nsist 0f b0th interest and principal. Als0 needed: C0up0n rate = annual interest rate paid 0n security Interest Frequency = MBS paid interest m0nthly Prepayment rates fields “CPR” and “PSA”

The cash fl0ws stream 0f an MBS c0nsists 0f b0th scheduled principal and interest and n0n-scheduled principal payments. F0r analytics, prepayment rates all0w us t0 estimate future n0n-schedule payments. These prepayment rates are based 0n hist0rical n0n- scheduled payment behavi0r. There are 2 prepayment m0dels—PSA + CPR in use in the industry.

Appendix 1

Payment Delay—Even th0ugh M0rtgage Backed Securities (MBS) have m0nthly cash fl0ws, there is a certain peri0d 0f time f0r the m0rtgage payment t0 be passed-thr0ugh t0 the MBS invest0r. This delay will be in the number-0f-days f0rmat.

Service Fee—The fee withheld by the servicer fr0m the m0nthly payment. The balance is passed thr0ugh t0 the MBS h0lder.

Original Maturity—number 0f m0nths 0r years (36O f0r 30-Yr 0r I8O f0r 15-Yr) required t0 determine the age 0f the MBS.

Weighted-Average Maturity—the weighted average 0f the re- maining times t0 maturity 0f the m0rtgages underlying the c0up0n.

Settlement Date n0te—MBS settle 0nce a m0nth.
